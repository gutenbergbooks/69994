<h3>SIR WILLIAM JONES.—DR. SAMUEL LEE.</h3>


<p class="no-indent">“If that boy were left naked and friendless on Salisbury
Plain, he would find the road to fame and riches!” the
tutor of <span class="smcap">Sir William Jones</span> was accustomed to say of
his illustrious pupil. His observation of the great
quality of <em>perseverance</em>, evinced in every act of study
prescribed to his scholar, doubtless impelled the teacher
to utter that remarkable affirmation. A discernment of
high genius in young Jones, with but little of the great
quality we have named, would have led Dr. Thackeray
to modify his remark. It would have been couched in
some such form as this: “If that boy had as much perseverance
as genius, he would find the road to fame and
riches, even if he were left naked and friendless on
Salisbury Plain.” But, had the instructor regarded his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
pupil as one endowed with the most brilliant powers of
mind, yet entirely destitute of perseverance, he would
have pronounced a judgment very widely different from
the first. “Alas, for this boy!” he might have said,
“how will these shining qualities, fitfully bursting forth
in his wayward course through life, displaying their
lustre in a thousand beginnings which will lead to
nothing, leave him to be regarded as an object of derision
where he might have won general admiration and
esteem, and cast him for subsistence on the bounty or
pity of others, when he might have been a noble example
of self-dependence!”</p>

<p>Let the reflection we would awaken by these introductory
sentences be of a healthy character. It is not
meant that celebrity or wealth are the most desirable
rewards of a well-spent life; but that the most resplendent
natural powers, unless combined with application
and industry, fail to bring happiness to the heart and
mind of the possessor, or to render him useful to his
brother men. It is sought to impress deeply and enduringly
on the youthful understanding, the irrefragable
truth that, while genius is a gift which none can create
for himself, and may be uselessly possessed, perseverance
has enabled many, who were born with only ordinary
faculties of imagination, judgment, and memory, to attain
a first-rate position in literature or science, or in the
direction of human affairs, and to leave a perpetual name
in the list of the world’s benefactors.</p>

<p>Has the youthful reader formed a purpose for life?
We ask not whether he has conceived a vulgar passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
for fame or riches, but earnestly exhort him to self-enquiry,
whether he be wasting existence in what is termed
amusement, or be daily devoting the moments at his
command to a diligent preparation for usefulness? Whether
he has hitherto viewed life as a journey to be trod
without aims and ends, or a grand field of enterprise
in which it is both his duty and interest to become an
industrious and honourable worker? Has he found, by
personal experience, even in the outset of life, that time
spent in purposeless inactivity or frivolity produces no
results on which the mind can dwell with satisfaction?
And has he learned, from the testimony of others, that
years so misspent bring only a feeling of self-accusation,
which increases in bitterness as the loiterer becomes
older, and the possibility of “redeeming the time” becomes
more doubtful? Did he ever reflect that indolence
never yet led to real distinction; that sloth never yet
opened the path to independence; that trifling never yet
enabled a man to make useful or solid acquirements?</p>

<p>If such reflections have already found a place in the
reader’s mind, and created in him some degree of yearning
to make his life not only a monument of independence,
but of usefulness, we invite him to a rapid review of the
lives of men among whom he will not only find the
highest exemplars of perseverance, but some whose peculiar
difficulties may resemble his own, and whose triumphs
may encourage him to pursue a course of similar excellence.
Purposing to awaken the spirit of exertion by
the presentation of striking examples rather than the
rehearsal of formal precepts, we proceed to open our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
condensed chronicle with a notice of the universal scholar
just named, and whose world-famed career has entitled
him to a first place in the records of the “Triumphs
of Perseverance.”</p>

<hr class="r33">

<h3>SIR WILLIAM JONES,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp35" id="i_b_004" style="max-width: 51em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_004.jpg" alt="Sir William Jones">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">Happily, had early admonitions of perseverance from his
mother, in whose widowed care he was left at three years
old; and who, “to his incessant importunities for information,
which she watchfully stimulated,” says his biographer,
Lord Teignmouth, “perpetually answered, ‘Read,
and you will know,’” His earnest mind cleaved to the
injunction. He could read any English book rapidly at
four years of age; and, though his right eye was injured
by an accident at five, and the sight of it ever remained
imperfect, his determination to learn triumphed over that
impediment. Again, the commencement of life seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
discouraging: he had been placed at Harrow School, at
the age of seven, but had his thigh-bone broken at nine,
and was compelled to be from school for twelve months.
Such was his progress, in spite of these untoward circumstances,
and although characterised, let it be especially
observed, as a boy “remarkable for diligence and
application rather than superiority of talent,” that he
was removed into the upper school, at Harrow, in his
twelfth year. At this period he is found writing out the
entire play of the “Tempest,” from memory, his companions
intending to perform it, and not having a copy
in their possession. Virgil’s Pastorals and Ovid’s Epistles
are, at the same age, turned into melodious English
verse by him; he has learned the Greek characters for
his amusement, and now applies himself to the language
in earnest; his mother has taught him drawing, during
the vacations; and he next composes a drama, on the
classic story of “Meleager,” which is acted in the school.
During the next two years he “wrote out the exercises
of many of the boys in the upper classes, and they were
glad to become his pupils;” meanwhile, in the holidays,
he learned French and arithmetic.</p>

<p>But this early and unremitting tension of the mind,
did it not leave the heart uncultured? Were not pride
and overweening growing within, and did not sourness of
temper display itself, and repel some whom the young
scholar’s acquirements might otherwise have attached to
him? Ah! youthful reader, thou wilt never find any
so proud as the ignorant; and, if thou wouldst not have
thy heart become a garden of rank and pestilential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
weeds, leave not the key thereof in the soft hand of
Indolence, but entrust it to the sinewed grasp of
Industry. What testimony give his early companions
to the temper and hearing of young Jones? The
celebrated Dr. Parr—in his own person also a high
exemplar of the virtue we are inculcating—was his
playmate in boyhood, remained his ardent friend in
manhood, and never spoke of their early attachment
without deep feeling. Dr. Bennet, afterwards Bishop
of Cloyne, thus speaks of Sir William Jones: “I knew
him from the early age of eight or nine, and he was
always an uncommon boy. I loved him and revered
him: and, though one or two years older than he was,
was always instructed by him.” ... “In a word, I can
only say of this amiable and wonderful man, that he had
more virtues and less faults than I ever yet saw in any
human being; and that the goodness of his head, admirable
as it was, was exceeded by that of his heart.”</p>

<p>With the boys, generally, he was a favourite. Dr.
Sumner, who succeeded Dr. Thackeray, used to say
Jones knew more Greek than himself. He soon learned
the Arabic characters, and was already able to read
Hebrew. A mere stripling, yet he would devote whole
nights to study, taking coffee or tea as an antidote to
drowsiness. Strangers were accustomed to enquire for
him, at the school, under the title of “the great scholar.”
But Dr. Sumner, during the last months spent at Harrow,
was obliged to interdict the juvenile “great scholar’s”
application, in consequence of a returning weakness
in his injured eye: yet he continued to compose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
and dictated to younger students; alternately practising
the games of Philidor and acquiring a knowledge of
chess. He had added a knowledge of botany and fossils
to the acquirements already mentioned, and had learned
Italian during his last vacation.</p>

<p>Let us mark, again, whether all this ardent intellectual
activity cramps the right growth of the affections,
and warps the heart’s sense of filial duty. “His mother,”
says his excellent biographer, “allowed him unlimited
credit on her purse; but of this indulgence, as he knew
her finances were restricted, he availed himself no further
than to purchase such books as were essential to his
improvement.” And when he is removed, at the age of
seventeen, to University College, Oxford, he is not
anxious to enter the world without restraint; his mother
goes to reside at Oxford, “at her son’s request.” And
how he toiled, and wished for college honours, not for
vain distinction, not for love of gain, but from the healthy
growth of that filial affection, which had strengthened
with his judgment and power of reflection! He “anxiously
wished for a fellowship,” says Lord Teignmouth,
“to enable him to draw less frequently upon his mother,
knowing the contracted nature of her income.” His
heart was soon to be gratified.</p>

<p>He commenced Arabic zealously, soon after reaching
the University; he perused, with assiduity, all the Greek
poets and historians of note; he read the entire works of
Plato and Lucian, with commentaries, constantly ready,
with a pen in his hand, to make any remark that he
judged worth preserving. What a contrast to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
“reader for amusement,” who will leave the priceless
treasure of a book ungathered, because it is hid in what
he calls a “lumbering folio,” and it wearies his hands,
or it is inconvenient to read it while lying along at ease
on the sofa! Yet this “great scholar” was no mere
musty book-worm; he did not claim kindred with
Dryasdust. While passing his vacations in London, he
daily attended the noted schools of Angelo, and acquired
a skill in horsemanship and fencing, as elegant accomplishments;
his evenings, at these seasons, being devoted
to the perusal of the best Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese
writers. At the University, how was the stripling urging
his way into the regions of oriental learning—that
grand high-road of his fame that was to be! He had
found Mirza, a Syrian, who possessed a knowledge
of the vernacular Arabic, and spent some portion of
every morning in writing out a translation of Galland’s
French version of the Arabian Tales into Arabic, from
the mouth of the Syrian; and he then corrected the
grammatical inaccuracies by the help of lexicons. From
the Arabic he urged his way into the Persian, becoming
soon enraptured with that most elegant of all eastern
languages. Such was this true disciple of “Perseverance”
at the age of <em>nineteen</em>.</p>

<p>And now some measure of the rewards of industry,
honour, and virtue begin to alight upon him. He is
appointed tutor to Lord Althorpe, son of the literary
Earl Spencer; finds his pupil possessed of a mind and
disposition that will render his office delightful; has the
range of one of the most splendid private libraries in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
kingdom, together with the refined and agreeable society
of Wimbledon Park; and is presented, soon after, with
a fellowship by his college.</p>

<p>Mark well, from two incidents which occur about this
time, what high conscientiousness, deep modesty, and
sterling independence characterise the true scholar.
The Duke of Grafton, then premier, offered him the
situation of government interpreter for eastern languages.
He declined it, recommending the Syrian, Mirza, as one
better qualified to fill it than himself. His recommendation
was neglected; and his biographer remarks that
“a better knowledge of the world would have led him to
accept the office, and to convey the emoluments to his
friend Mirza. He was too ingenuous to do so. He saw
the excellent lady who afterwards became his wife and
devoted companion in study; but ‘his fixed idea of an
honourable independence, and a determined resolution
never to owe his fortune to a wife, or her kindred, excluded
all ideas of a matrimonial connection,’” at that
period, although the affection he had conceived was
ardent.</p>

<p>In the year of his majority, we find him commencing
his famous “Commentaries on Asiatic Poetry;” copying
the keys of the Chinese language; learning German, by
conversation, grammar, and dictionary, during three
weeks passed at Spa with his noble pupil; acquiring a
knowledge of the broad-sword exercise from an old pensioner
at Chelsea; continuing to attend the two schools
of Signor Angelo; and secretly taking lessons in dancing
from Gallini, the dancing-master of Earl Spencer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
family, until he surprises the elegant inhabitants of
Wimbledon by joining with grace in the amusements of
their evening parties.</p>

<p>Such was the truly magnificent advancement made by
this illustrious disciple of “Perseverance,” up to the age
of twenty-one. Think, reader, how much may be done
in the opening of life! How elevated the course of Sir
William Jones! What cheering self-approval must he
have experienced, in looking back on the youthful years
thus industriously spent; but what humbling reflection,
what severe self-laceration would he have felt, had he
allowed indolence to master him, ease to enervate him,
listlessness and dissipation to render him a nameless and
worthless nothing in the world!</p>

<p>At the close of his twenty-first year he peruses the
little treatise of our ancient lawyer, Fortescue, in praise
of the laws of England. His large learning enabled him
to compare the laws of other countries with his own;
and though he had, hitherto, enthusiastically preferred
the laws of republican Greece, reflection, on the perusal
of this treatise, led him to prefer the laws of England to
all others. His noble biographer adds a remark which
indicates the solidity and perspicacity of Sir William
Jones’s judgment:—“He was not, however, regardless
of the deviations in practice from the theoretical perfection
of the constitution, in a contested election, of which
he was an unwilling spectator.” Yet the perfect <em>theory</em>
of our constitution so far attracted him, as to lead him,
from this time, to the resolve of uniting the study of the
law to his great philological acquirements; his purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
was neither rashly formed, nor soon relinquished, like
the miscalled “purposes” of weak men and idlers; it
resulted in his elevation to high and honourable usefulness,
in the lapse of a few years.</p>

<p>In his twenty-second year the “great scholar” undertakes
a task which no other quality than perseverance
could have enabled him to accomplish. The King of
Denmark, then on a visit to this country, brought over
with him an eastern manuscript, containing a life of
Nadir Shah, and expressed his wish to the officers of
government to have it translated into French, by an
English scholar. The under secretary of state applied
to Sir William Jones, who recommended Major Dow,
the able translator of a Persian history, to perform the
work. Major Dow refused: and, though hints of greater
patronage did not influence the inclination of Sir William
Jones, his reflection that the reputation of English
learning would be dishonoured by the Danish king
taking back the manuscript, with a report that no scholar
in our country had courage to undertake the difficult
labour, impelled him to enter on it. The fact that he
had a French style to acquire, in order to discharge his
task, and had, even then, to get a native Frenchman to
go over the translation, to render it a scholar-like production,
made the undertaking extremely arduous. It
was, however, accomplished magnificently; and the adventurous
translator added a treatise on oriental poetry,
“such as no other person in England could then have
written.” He was immediately afterwards made a
member of the Royal Society of Copenhagen, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
recommended by the King of Denmark to the particular
patronage of his own sovereign.</p>

<p>At twenty-six he was made a fellow of the Royal
Society of England, and took his degree of Master of
Arts the year after. Meanwhile he was composing his
celebrated Persian Grammar; had found the means of
entering effectively on the study of Chinese, a language
at that time surrounded with unspeakable difficulties;
had written part of a Turkish history; and was assiduously
copying Arabic manuscripts in the Bodleian.
The “Commentaries on Asiatic Poetry” were published
in his twenty-eighth year, being five years after they
were finished; his modesty, that invariable attendant of
true merit, and his love of correctness, having induced
him to lay the manuscript before Dr. Parr, and other
profound judges, ere he ventured to give his composition
to the world. Amidst so many absorbing engagements
his biographer still notes the correct state of his heart.
He was a regular correspondent with his excellent
mother, and ever paid the most affectionate attention to
her and his sister.</p>

<p>In his twenty-eighth year he devotes himself more
exclusively to his legal studies, goes the Oxford circuit
after being called to the bar, and afterwards attends regularly
at Westminster Hall. Except the publication of
a translation of the speeches of Isæus, he performs no
remarkable literary labour for the next few years; his
professional practice having become very considerable,
and his thoughts being strongly directed towards a
vacant judgeship, at Calcutta, as the situation in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
he felt assured, by the union of his legal knowledge with
his skill in oriental languages, he could best serve the
interests of learning and of mankind.</p>

<p>Before this object of his laudable ambition was attained,
however, Sir William Jones gave proof, as our great
Englishman, Milton, had given before him, that the
mightiest erudition does not narrow, but serves truly to
enlarge the mind, and to nourish its sympathies with the
great brotherhood of humanity. The war with the
United States of America had commenced, and he declared
himself against it; he wrote a splendid Latin ode,
entitled “Liberty,” in which his patriotic and philanthropic
sentiments are most nobly embodied; and became
a candidate, on what are now called “liberal principles,”
for the representation of Oxford. He withdrew,
after further reflection, from the candidateship, still purposing
to devote his life to the East, but not before he
had testified his disapproval of harsh ministerial measures,
by publishing an “Enquiry into the legal mode
of suppressing riots, with a constitutional plan for their
suppression.” Finally, to the record of this part of his
life, Lord Teignmouth adds the relation, that Sir William
Jones had found time to attend the lectures of the
celebrated John Hunter, and to acquire some knowledge
of anatomy; while he had advanced sufficiently far into
the mathematics to be able to read and understand the
“Principia” of Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>The last eleven years of the illustrious scholar’s life
form the most brilliant part of his career, and only leave
us to lament that his days were not more extended. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the month of March, 1783, being then in his thirty-seventh
year, he was appointed a judge of the supreme
court of judicature, Fortwilliam, Calcutta, and on that
occasion received the honour of knighthood. In the
following month he married the eldest daughter of Dr.
Shipley, Bishop of St. Asaph, and thus happy in a union
with the lady to whom he had been long devoted, almost
immediately embarked for India.</p>

<p>As a concluding lesson from the life of Sir William
Jones, let us note how unsubduable is the intellect
trained by long and early habits of perseverance, under
the corrupting and enfeebling influences of honours and
prosperity. On the voyage, the “great scholar” drew
up a list of “Objects of Enquiry.” If he could have
fulfilled the gigantic schemes which were thus unfolding
themselves to his ardent mind, the world must have
been stricken with amazement. The list is too long to
be detailed here; suffice it to say, that it enumerates
the “Laws of the Hindus and Mahommedans,” “The
History of the Ancient World;” all the sciences, all the
arts and inventions of all the Asiatic nations, and the
various kinds of government in India. Following the
list of “Objects of Enquiry,” is a sketch of works he
purposes to write and publish; including “Elements of
the Laws of England,” “History of the American War,”
an epic poem, to be entitled “Britain Discovered,”
“Speeches, Political and Forensic,” “Dialogues, Philosophical
and Historical,” and a volume of letters, with
translations of some portions of the Scriptures into
Arabic and Persian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Intense and indefatigable labour enabled him to complete
his masterly “Digest of Mahommedan and Hindu
Law,” but to accomplish this work, so invaluable to the
European conquerors of Hindoostan, he had first, critically,
to master the Sanscrit, at once the most perfect
and most difficult of known languages. If it be remembered
that Sir William Jones was also most active
in the discharge of his judicial duties, our admiration
will be increased. His translation of the “Ordinances
of Menu,” a Sanscrit work, displaying the Hindoo system
of religious and civil duties—and of the Indian drama
of “Sacontala,” written a century before the Christian
era—and his production of a “Dissertation on the
Gods of Greece, Italy, and Rome,” were among the last
of his complete works. He also edited the first volume
of the “Asiatic Researches;” and gave an impetus to
eastern enquiry among Europeans, by instituting the
Asiatic Society, of which he was the first president. His
annual discourses before that assembly have been published,
and are well known and highly valued.</p>

<p>The death of this great and good man, though sudden,
being occasioned by the rapid liver complaint of Bengal,
was as peaceful as his life had been noble and virtuous.
A friend, who saw him die, says that he expired “without
a groan, and with a serene and complacent look.” His
death took place on the 27th April, 1794, when he was
only in his forty-eighth year; yet he had acquired a
“critical knowledge” of eight languages—English,
Latin, French, Italian, Greek, Arabic, Persian, Sanscrit;
he knew eight others less perfectly, but was able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
to read them with the occasional use of a dictionary—Spanish,
Portuguese, German, Runic, Hebrew, Bengalee,
Hindostanee, Turkish; and he knew so much of
twelve other tongues, that they were perfectly attainable
by him, had life and leisure permitted his continued
application to them—Tibetian, Pâli, Phalavi, Deri, Russian,
Syriac, Ethiopic, Coptic, Welsh, Swedish, Dutch,
Chinese. Twenty-eight languages in all; such is his
own account. When you sum up the other diversified
accomplishments and attainments of the scarce forty-eight
years of Sir William Jones, reflect deeply, youthful
reader, on what may be achieved by “perseverance,”
and when you have reflected—<em>resolve</em>.</p>

<p>To that emphatic early lesson of “read and you will
learn,” and to his ready opportunities and means of culture,
we must, undoubtedly, attribute much of the
“great scholar’s” success. In the life of one still living,
and enjoying the honours and rewards of virtuous perseverance,
it will be seen that even devoid of help, unstimulated
by any affectionate voice in the outset, and
surrounded with discouragements, almost at every step,
the cultivation of this grand quality infallibly leads on
to signal triumph.</p>

<h3>DR. SAMUEL LEE,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">Now Regius Professor of Hebrew in the University of
Cambridge, being the son of a poor widow, who was left
to struggle for the support of two younger children, was
apprenticed to a carpenter, at twelve years of age, after
receiving a merely elementary instruction in reading,
writing, and arithmetic in the charity-school of the
village of Longmore, in Shropshire. His love of books
became fervent, and the Latin quotations he found in
such as were within his reach kindled a desire to penetrate
the mystery of their meaning. The sounds of the
language, too, which he heard in a Catholic chapel, where
his master had undertaken some repairs, increased this
desire. At seventeen he purchased “Ruddiman’s Latin
Rudiments,” and soon committed the whole to memory.
With the help of “Corderius’ Colloquies,” “Entick’s
Dictionary,” and “Beza’s Testament,” he began to make
his way into the vestibule of Roman learning; but of
the magnificent inner-glory he had, as yet, scarcely
caught a glimpse. The obstacles seemed so great for an
unassisted adventurer, that he one day besought a priest
of the chapel, where he was still at work, to afford him
some help. “Charity begins at home!” was the repelling
reply to his application; but, whether meant to indicate
the priest’s own need of instruction, or sordid
unwillingness to afford his help without pecuniary remuneration,
does not appear. Unchilled by this repulse,
the young and unfriended disciple of “perseverance”
girt up “the loins of his mind” for his solitary but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
onward travel. Yet how uncheering the landscape
around him! Think of it, and blush, young reader, if
thou art surrounded with ease and comfort, but hast
yielded to indolence; ponder on it, and take courage, if
thou art the companion of hardship, but resolvest to be
a man, one day, amongst men. Young Lee’s wages
were but six shillings weekly at seventeen years old;
and from this small sum he had not only to find food,
but to pay for his washing and lodging. The next year
his weekly income was increased one shilling, and the
year following another. Privation, even of the necessaries
of life, he had to suffer, not seldom, in order to
enable himself to possess what he desired, now more intensely
than ever. He successively purchased a Latin
Bible, Cæsar, Justin, Sallust, Cicero, Virgil, Horace,
Ovid; having frequently to sell his volume as soon as
he had mastered it in order to buy another. But what
of that? The true disciple of perseverance looks onward
with hope—hope which is not fantastic, but founded in
the firmest reason—to the day when his meritorious and
ennobling toil shall have its happy fruition, and he shall
know no scarcity of books.</p>

<p>Conquest of one language has inspired him with zeal
for further victory; it is the genuine nature of enterprise.
Freed from his apprenticeship he purchases a Greek
grammar, testament, lexicon, and exercises; and soon, the
self-taught carpenter, the scholar of toil and privation,
holds converse, in their own superlative tongue, with the
simple elegance of Xenophon, the eloquence and wisdom
of Plato, and the wit of Lucian; he becomes familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
with the glorious “Iliad,” with the pathos and refinement,
the force and splendour, of the “Antigone,” of
Sophocles.</p>

<p>“Unaided by any instructor, uncheered by any literary
companion,” says one who narrates the circumstances
of his early career, “he still persevered.” What
wonder, when he had discovered so much to cheer him
in the delectable mental realm he was thus subduing
for himself! And he was now endued with the full
energy of conquest. He purchased “Bythner’s Hebrew
Grammar,” and “Lyra Prophetica,” with a Hebrew
Psalter, and was soon able to read the Psalms in the
original. Buxtorf’s grammar and lexicon with a Hebrew
Bible followed; an accident threw in his way the “Targum”
of Onkelos, and with the Chaldee grammar in
Bythner, and Schindler’s lexicon, he was soon able to
read it. Another effort, and he was able to read the
Syriac Testament and the Samaritan Pentateuch, thus
gaining acquaintance with four branches of the ancient
Aramœan or Shemitic family of languages, in addition
to his knowledge of the two grand Pelasgic dialects.</p>

<p>He was now five-and-twenty, and had mastered six
languages, without the slightest help from any living instructor;
some of the last-named books were heavily
expensive; yet, true to the nobility of life that had distinguished
his early youth, he had not relaxed the reins
of economy, but had purchased a chest of tools, which
had cost him twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>Suddenly an event befel him which seemed to wither
not only his prospects of further mental advancement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
but plunged him into the deepest distress. A fire, which
broke out in a house he was repairing, consumed his
chest of tools; and, as he had no money to purchase
more, and had now to feel solicitude for the welfare of
an affectionate wife, as well as for himself, his affliction
was heavy. In this distracting difficulty he turned his
thoughts towards commencing a village school, but even
for this he lacked the means of procuring the necessary,
though scanty, furniture. Uprightness and meritorious
industry, however, seldom fail to attract benevolent help
to a man in need. Archdeacon Corbett, the resident
philanthropic clergyman of Longmore, heard of Samuel
Lee’s distress, sent for him, and on hearing the relation
of his laudable struggles, used his interest to place him
in the mastership of Shrewsbury Charity School, giving
him what was of still higher value, an introduction to
the great oriental scholar, Dr. Jonathan Scott.</p>

<p>New triumphs succeeded his misfortunes, and a cheering
and honourable future was preparing. Dr. Scott
put into the hands of his new and humble friend
elementary books on Arabic, Persian, and Hindostanee;
and, in a few months, the disciple of perseverance was
not only able to read and translate, but even essayed to
compose in his newly-acquired languages. So effectually
had he mastered these eastern tongues, that the good
doctor used his influence in introducing him as private
tutor to sons of gentlemen going out to India; and, after
another brief probation, procured him admission into
Queen’s College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>Our sketch of this remarkable living scholar may here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
be cut short. He has made himself master of twenty
languages, distinguished himself alike by the virtue of
his private life, his practical eloquence in the pulpit and
zeal for the church, of which he is an honoured member;
and, in addition to the service he has rendered to oriental
literature, by his new Hebrew grammar and lexicon, his
revision of Sir William Jones’s Persian grammar, and a
number of philological tracts, has won respect and gratitude,
by diligent and laborious supervision of numerous
translations of the Scriptures into eastern tongues, prepared
by the direction and at the cost of the British and
Foreign Bible Society.</p>

<p>If the young scholar be bent on the acquirement of
languages, he will find, in the lives of Alexander, Murray,
Leyden, Heyne, Carey, Marshman, Morrison, Magliabechi,
and a hundred others, striking proofs of the ease
with which the mind overcomes all difficulties when it is
armed with determination, and never becomes a recreant
from the banner of perseverance.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">SHAKSPEARE.—SPENSER.—-JOHNSON.—GIFFORD.—GIBBON.</p>


<p class="no-indent">Creative genius is popularly held to be dependent on
faculties widely diverse from those required by the mere
man of learning. The linguist is usually regarded as a
traveller on a beaten track; the poet, as a discoverer of
new regions. Success for the man of learning is considered
to depend on diligence in the exercise of the
memory and judgment; while obedience to impulse
seems to be the mental law popularly allotted to poets.
Let the young reader inquire for himself, whether there
is not something of fallacy in this popular notion.</p>

<hr class="r33">

<h3>SHAKSPEARE,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">The most highly endowed of human intelligences, was
under as great necessity of learning the vocabulary of
the English tongue as the very commonest mind. He,
like all other men, however inferior to him in understanding
or imagination, was born without any innate
knowledge of things, or their natures, words, or the
rules for fashioning them in order, or combining them
with grace and harmony, eloquence and strength. Every
author of the first class was in the same predicament
mentally at birth; they had everything to learn, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the perfection of their learning depended on their own
effort. It may be equally affirmed, then, of the highest
poet and the greatest linguist, of Shakspeare and Sir
William Jones, that neither had any “royal road” for
gaining his peculiar eminence.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_023.jpg" alt="Shakspeare">
</figure>

<p>The little we know of the personal history of Shakspeare
renders it necessary for us to attribute a very ample
measure of his unrivalled excellence to that quality of
the mind which we are insisting upon as requisite for
the performance of great and exalted labours. If it be
true that schoolmasters taught him little, how indefatigable
must have been that perseverance which enabled
him, not simply to equal, but so immeasurably to transcend
his more learned contemporaries and fellow-workers,
in the wealth of his language, and in the beauty and
fitness of its application! If his helps were few, so much
the more astonishing is the energy and continuity of
effort which issued in securing for him who exerted it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the highest name in the world’s literature. Nor can
minds of primal order be satisfied with a passing ovation
that may be forgotten; they thirst to render their
triumphs monumental. Our grand dramatist piled effort
upon effort, until he left to the world the priceless
legacy of his thirty-seven plays. His mind had none of
the sickly quality which views a settled form of composition
as irksome, and indulges its unhealthy fantasies
in irregular and useless essays. He wrought out his
magnificent and self-appointed task to the end; he made
his own monument worthy of himself.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Was not less an exemplar of diligence than of skill in the
architecture of verse. The mere task-work of constructing
three thousand eight hundred and fifty-four stanzas,
comprising forty-four thousand six hundred and sixty-eight
lines, would have wearied out the industry of any
mind whose powers were not indefatigable. He died,
too, before his magnificent design was complete, or the
elaborate monument of his fame might have been still
more colossal. Superiority to mental indolence, so manifest
in the lives of Shakspeare and Spenser, is equally
noticeable in the cases of Chaucer and Milton, of Ben
Jonson and Beaumont and Fletcher, of Dryden and Pope,
of Byron and Wordsworth, our other great poets; and,
indeed, in the histories of the great poets of all nations.
When the quantity of their composition is considered,
and it is remembered how much thought must have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
expended in the bringing together of choice materials,
how much care in the polishing and adorning of each
part, and of the whole, of their seemly fabrics, the degree
of perseverance exercised in the erection of so many immortal
superstructures of the mind is presented to reflection
with commanding self-evidence. But let us track,
more circumstantially, the life-path, so proverbial for
vicissitude, of some of the children of genius, that we
may see how the energy of true men is neither quelled
by difficulty nor enervated by success.</p><br>

<h3>JOHNSON,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">Afterwards so famous as the great arbiter of literary criticism,
is found leaving college without a degree, and, from
sheer poverty, at the age of twenty-two. The sale of his
deceased father’s effects, a few months after, affords him
but twenty pounds, and he is constrained to become an
usher in a grammar school in Leicestershire. In the
next year he performs a translation of “Lobo’s Voyage
to Abyssinia” for a Birmingham bookseller, returns to
Lichfield, his birth-place, and publishes proposals for
printing, by subscription, the Latin poems of Politian,
the life of that author, and a history of Latin poetry
from the era of Petrarch to the time of Politian. His
project failed to attract patrons, and he next offered his
services to Cave, the original projector of the “Gentleman’s
Magazine.” Cave accepted his offer, but on conditions
which compelled Johnson to make application<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
elsewhere for earning the means of living. He again
offered to become assistant to the master of a grammar
school; but, in spite of the great learning he had even
then acquired, he was rejected, from the fear that his
peculiar nervous and involuntary gestures would render
him an object of ridicule with his pupils. Such was
one of the disabilities of constitution under which this
humbly-born and strong-minded man laboured through
life.</p>

<p>Won, not by his ungainly person, but by the high
qualities of his mind, a widow, with a little fortune of
eight hundred pounds, yielded him her hand, in this
season of his poverty; and he immediately opened a
classical school in his native town. The celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Garrick, then about eighteen years old, became his pupil.
His scheme, however, did not succeed; his newly acquired
property was exhausted; and he and Garrick, then eight
years his junior, set out together for London, with the
resolve to seek their fortunes in the larger world. Garrick
in a short time was acknowledged as the first genius
on the stage, and made his way to wealth almost without
difficulty. A longer and more toilful period of trial fell
to the lot of the scholar and author. He first offered to
the booksellers a manuscript tragedy, supposed to be his
“Irene,” but could find no one willing to accept it.
Cave gave him an engagement to translate the “History
of the Council of Trent.” He received forty-nine
pounds for part of the translation, but it was never completed
for lack of sale. His pecuniary condition was so
low, soon after this, that he and Savage, having walked,
conversing, round Grosvenor Square, till four in the
morning, and beginning to feel the want of refreshment,
could not muster between them more than fourpence-halfpenny!
He received ten guineas for his celebrated
poem of “London;” but though Pope said, “The
author, whoever he was, could not be long concealed,”
no further advantage was derived by Johnson from its
publication. Hearing of a vacancy in the mastership of
another grammar school in Leicestershire, he, once more,
proceeds thither as a candidate. The consequences of
the poverty which had prevented him from remaining at
the university till he could take a degree were now grievously
felt. The statutes of the place required that the
person chosen should be a Master of Arts. Some interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
was made to obtain him that degree from the Dublin
University; but it failed, and he was again thrown back
on London.</p>

<p>In spite of his melancholic constitution, these repeated
disappointments, so far from filling him with despair,
seem only to have quickened his invention, and strengthened
his resolution to continue the struggle for fame.
He formed numerous projects on his return to the metropolis;
but none succeeded except his contributions to
the “Gentleman’s Magazine;” these were, chiefly, the
“Parliamentary Debates,” which the world read with
the belief that they were thus becoming acquainted with
the eloquence of Chatham, Walpole, and their compeers,
and little dreaming that those speeches were “written
in a garret in Exeter Street,” by a poverty-stricken
author. The talent displayed in this anonymous labour
did not serve, as yet, to free him from difficulties. He
next undertook to collect and arrange the tracts forming
the miscellany, entitled “Harleian.” Osborne, the
bookseller, was his employer in this work; and, having
purchased Lord Oxford’s library, the bookseller also
employed Johnson to form a catalogue. To relieve his
drudgery, Johnson occasionally paused to peruse the
book that came to hand; Osborne complained of this;
a dispute arose; and the bookseller, with great roughness,
gave the author the lie. The incident so characteristic
of Johnson, and so often related, now took place—Johnson
seized a folio, and knocked the bookseller
down. The act was far from justifiable; but his indignation
under the offence must have been great, as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
rigid adherence to speaking the truth was so observable,
that one of his most intimate friends declared “he always
talked as if he were speaking on oath.”</p>

<p>He escaped, at length, from some degree of the humiliation
which attaches to poverty. He projected his great
work—the English Dictionary; several of the wealthiest
booksellers entered into the scheme, and Johnson now
left lodging in the courts and alleys about the Strand,
and took a house in Gough Square, Fleet Street. This
did not occur till he was eight-and-thirty; so great a
portion of life had he passed in almost perpetual contest
with pecuniary difficulties; nor was he entirely freed
from them for some years to come. During the years
spent in the exhausting labour of his Dictionary, the
fifteen hundred guineas he received for the copyright
were consumed on amanuenses, and the provision necessary
for himself and his wife. The “Rambler” was
written during these years in which his Dictionary was
in course of publication, and the circumstances of its
composition are most note-worthy among the “Triumphs
of Perseverance.” With the exception of five numbers,
every essay was written by Johnson himself; and it was
regularly issued every Tuesday and Friday, for two years.
The perseverance which enabled him so punctually to
execute a stated task, even while continuously labouring
in the greater work in which he was engaged, is remarkable:
but the young reader’s thought ought to be more
deeply fixed on the consideration that a life of unremitting
devotion to study—unconquered by difficulty, and
straitness of circumstances—had rendered him able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
easily to pour forth the treasures of a full mind. Although
apparently the product of great care, and stored
with the richest moral reflections, these essays were
usually written in haste, frequently while the printer’s
boy was waiting, and not even read over before given to
him. This was not recklessness in Johnson, though it
would have been folly in one whose mind was not most
opulently stored with matured thought, and who had not
attained such a habit of modulating sentences, as to
render it almost mechanical. Such attainments can
only be reached by the most determined disciple of
perseverance. “A man may write at any time, if he
will set himself doggedly to it,” was Johnson’s own saying;
but he could not have verified it, unless his mind, by
assiduous application, had been filled with the materials
of writing. He was, likewise, held in high celebrity as
the best converser of his age; but he acknowledged that
he had attained his extraordinary accuracy and flow of
language by having early laid it down as a fixed rule to
arrange his thoughts before expressing them, and never
to suffer a careless or unmeaning expression to escape
from him.</p>

<p>The profits of a second periodical, “The Idler,” and
the subscriptions for his edition of Shakspeare, were the
means by which he supported himself for the four or five
years immediately preceding the age of fifty. His wife
had already died, and his aged mother being near her
dissolution, in order to reach Lichfield, and pay her the
last offices of filial piety, he devoted one fortnight to the
composition of his beautiful and immortal tale of “Rasselas,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
for which he received one hundred pounds. He
did not arrive in time to close her eyes, but saw her decently
interred, and then hastened back to London, to
go, once more, into lodgings and retrench expenses.
The next three years of his life appear to have been
passed in even more than his early poverty; but the end
of his difficulties was approaching.</p>

<p>The last twenty-two years of his existence—from the
age of fifty-three to seventy-five—were spent in the receipt
of a royal pension of three hundred pounds per
annum; in the society of persons of fortune, who considered
themselves honoured by the company of the once
poverty-stricken and unknown scholar; in the companionship
of Edmund Burke, and Oliver Goldsmith, and
Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Joseph Warton, and others
whose names are durably written on the roll of genius,
and in the receipt of the highest honours of learning—for
the Universities, both of Dublin and Oxford, conferred
upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws, and the
Oxford University had previously sent him the degree of
Master of Arts. Regarded as the great umpire of literary
taste, receiving deference and respect wherever he went,
and no longer driven to his pen by necessity, this honoured
exemplar of perseverance did not pass through his
remaining course in unproductive indolence. In addition
to less important works, his “Lives of the Poets”
was produced in this closing period of his life, and is
well known as the most valuable and useful of his labours,
with the exception of his great Dictionary.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM GIFFORD,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp35" id="i_b_033" style="max-width: 48.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_033.jpg" alt="William Gifford">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">In the early circumstances of his life, is a still more
striking exemplar of the virtue of perseverance. He was
left an orphan at thirteen years of age, was sent to sea
for a twelvemonth, and was then taken home by his godfather,
who had seized upon whatever his mother had
left, as a means of repaying himself for money lent to
her, and was now constrained to pay some attention to
the boy, by the keen remonstrances of his neighbours.
He was sent to school, and made such rapid progress in
arithmetic that, in a few months, he was at the head of
the school, and frequently assisted his master. The receipt
of a trifle for these services raised in him the thought of
one day becoming a schoolmaster, in the room of a
teacher in the town of Ashburton, who was growing old
and infirm. He mentioned his scheme to his godfather,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
who treated it with contempt, and forthwith apprenticed
him to a shoemaker. His new master subjected him to
the greatest degradation, made him the common drudge
of his household, and took from him the means of pursuing
his favourite study of arithmetic.</p>

<p>“I could not guess the motives for this at first,” he
says—for his narrative is too remarkable at this period
of his struggles, to be told in any other than his own
language—“but at length discovered that my master
destined his youngest son for the situation to which I
aspired. I possessed, at this time, but one book in the
world, it was a treatise on algebra, given to me by a
young woman, who had found it in a lodging-house.
I considered it as a treasure, but it was a treasure locked
up, for it supposed the reader to be well acquainted with
simple equations, and I knew nothing of the matter.
My master’s son had purchased ‘Fenning’s Introduction;’
this was precisely what I wanted; but he carefully
concealed it from me, and I was indebted to chance
alone for stumbling upon his hiding-place. I sat up for
the greatest part of several nights, successively; and,
before he suspected that his treatise was discovered, had
completely mastered it. I could now enter upon my
own, and that carried me pretty far into the science.
This was not done without difficulty. I had not a farthing
on earth, nor a friend to give me one; pen, ink,
and paper, therefore, were, for the most part, as completely
out of my reach as a crown and sceptre. There
was, indeed, a resource, but the utmost caution and
secrecy were necessary in applying to it. I beat out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
pieces of leather as smooth as possible, and wrought
my problems on them with a blunted awl; for the rest,
my memory was tenacious, and I could multiply and
divide by it to a great extent.”</p>

<p>He essayed the composition of rhyme, and the rehearsal
of his verses secured him a few pence from his acquaintances.
He now furnished himself with pens, ink, and
paper, and even bought some books of geometry and of
the higher branches of algebra; but was obliged to conceal
them, and to pursue his studies by continued caution.
Some of his verses, however, were shown to his
master, and were understood to contain satirical reflections
upon his oppressor. His books and papers were
seized upon, by way of punishment; and he was reduced
to the deepest despair. “I look back,” he says, in his
own admirable narrative, “on that part of my life which
immediately followed this event with little satisfaction:
it was a period of gloom, and savage unsociability: by
degrees I sunk into a kind of corporeal torpor; or, if
roused into activity by the spirit of youth, wasted the
exertion in splenetic and vexatious tricks, which alienated
the few acquaintances compassion had left me.”</p>

<p>The heart revolts at the brutal injustice which drove
Gifford’s young nature thus to harden itself into gloomy
endurance of his lot, by “savage unsociability;” but a
mind like his could not take that stamp for life. His
disposition grew again buoyant, and his aspirations
began to rekindle, as the term of his bondage grew
shorter. Had he found no deliverance till it had legally
expired, it may be safely affirmed that he would then have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
forced his way into eminence by self-assisted efforts;
but an accidental circumstance emancipated him a year
before the legal expiry of his apprenticeship. Mr.
Cookesley, a philanthropic surgeon, having learnt from
Gifford himself the facts of his hard history, through
mere curiosity awakened by hearing some of his rhymes
repeated, started ‘A subscription for purchasing the
remainder of the time of William Gifford, and for enabling
him to improve himself in writing and English
grammar.’ Enough was collected to satisfy his master’s
demand, he was placed at school with a clergyman, made
his way into the classics, displayed such diligence that
more money was raised to continue him in his promising
course; and in two years and two months from the day
of his liberation, he was considered by his instructor to
be fit for the University, and was sent to Exeter College,
Oxford.</p>

<p>Perseverance! what can it not effect? It enabled
Gifford to surmount difficulties arising from the most
vulgar and brutifying influences, and to make his way
triumphantly into an intellectual region of delectable
enjoyment. From a boy neglected and degraded—from
a youth baffled and thwarted in his aims at a higher state
of existence than that of merely living to labour in order
to eat, drink, and be clothed—from one fastening his
desire upon knowledge, only to be scorned and mocked,
and treated as a criminal where he was meriting applause—from
a poor pitiable straggler longing for mental
breathing-room, amid the coarse conversation he would
undoubtedly hear from his master, and those who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
his associates, and sinking for some period into sullen
despair with his hardship, that like an untoward sky
seemed to promise no break of relieving light—he becomes
a glad and easier student; is enabled not merely
‘to improve himself in writing and English grammar,’
but, in six-and-twenty months, becomes a converser, in
their own noble language, with the great spirits of Rome
and Greece: and enters the most venerable arena of
learning in Britain, to become a rival in elegant scholarship
with the young heirs to coronets and titles, and to
England’s widest wealth and influence. What a change
did those ancient halls of architectural grandeur, with
all their associations of great intellectual names, present
for the young and ardent toiler who, but six-and-twenty
months before, had bent over the <em>last</em> from morning to
night, shut out from all that could cheer or elevate the
mind, and surrounded with nought but that which tended
to disgust and degrade it!</p>

<p>Nor did the career of the young disciple of perseverance,
when arrived at his new and loftier stage of struggle,
discredit the foresight of those who had assisted him.
His first benefactor died before Gifford took his degree,
but he was enabled by the generosity of Lord Grosvenor
to pursue his studies at the University to a successful
issue. After some absence on the continent, as travelling
tutor to the nobleman just mentioned, he entered on his
course as an author, and gained some distinction; but
won his chief celebrity, as well as most substantial rewards,
while Editor of the “Quarterly Review”—an
office he held from the commencement of that periodical,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
1809, till his death, on the last day of 1826, when he
had reached the age of seventy-one. In the performance
of this critical service he had a salary of one thousand a
year; and it is a noble conclusion to the history of this
successful scholar of Perseverance, that true-hearted
gratitude led him to bequeath the bulk of his fortune to
Mr. Cookesley, the son of his early benefactor.</p>

<p>The superiority of genius to difficulties, and the certainty
with which it achieves high triumphs through
longer or shorter paths of vicissitude, might be shown
from the memoirs of Erasmus, and Mendelsohn, and
Goldsmith, and Holcroft, and Kirke White, and others,
almost a countless host. Early poverty may be said,
however, to stimulate the children of Genius to exertion;
and its influence may be judged to weaken the merit of
their perseverance, since their triumphs may be dated
from deep desire to escape from its disadvantages. That
such a feeling has been participated by many, or all, of
the illustrious climbers after literary distinction, it may
not be denied; though the world usually attributes more
to its workings in the minds of men of genius than the
interior truth, if known, would warrant: the strong
necessity to create—the restless power to embody their
thinkings—these deep-seated springs of exertion in intellectual
men, if understood, would afford a truer solution
of their motives for beginning, and the determination
to excel for continuing their course, than any mere
sordid impulses with which they are often charged. Let
us turn to a celebrated name, around which no irksome
influences of poverty gathered, either at the outset of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
his life, or in his progress to literary distinction. His
systematic direction of the knowledge acquired by inquiries
as profound as they were diversified, and his
application of the experience of life, alike to the same
great end, afford an admirable spectacle of the noblest
perseverance, and of memorable victory over the seductions
of ease and competence.</p>

<h3>GIBBON,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp35" id="i_b_039" style="max-width: 53.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_039.jpg" alt="Gibbon">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">The author of the unrivalled “Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire,” was born to considerable fortune. He
left the University at eighteen, after great loss of time,
as he tells us in his instructive autobiography, and with
what was worse, habits of expense and dissipation. His
father being under distressing anxiety on account of his
son’s irregularities, and, afterwards, from what he deemed
of greater moment, young Gibbon’s sudden avowal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
conversion to the doctrines of the Roman Catholic
church, placed him abroad, under the strict care of a
Protestant minister. Gibbon began to awake to reflection;
and, without prescription from his new guardian,
voluntarily entered on severe study. He diligently
translated the best Roman writers, turned them into
French, and then again into Latin, comparing Cicero
and Livy, and Seneca and Horace, with the best orators
and historians, philosophers and poets, of the moderns.
He next advanced to the Greek, and pursued a similar
course with the treasures of that noble literature. He
afterwards commenced an inquiry into the Law of Nations,
and sedulously perused the treatises of Grotius,
Puffendorf, Locke, Bayle, and Montesquieu, the acknowledged
authorities on that great subject. He mentions
three books which absorbed more than the usual interest
he felt in whatever he read: “Pascal’s Provincial Letters,”
the “Abbe de la Bléterie’s Life of the Emperor
Julian,” and “Giannone’s Civil History of Naples:”
the character of these works shadows forth the grand
design which was gradually forming in his mind.</p>

<p>Yet without method, without taking care to store up
this various knowledge in such a mode that it might not
be mere lumber in the memory, he speedily discerned
that even years spent in industrious reading would be,
comparatively, of little worth. He, therefore, began to
digest his various reading in a common-place book, according
to the method recommended by Locke. The
eager and enthusiastic student—for such he had now
become—by this systematic arrangement of his knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
under heads, perceived his wants more distinctly, and
entered into correspondence for the solution of historic
difficulties, with some of the most illustrious scholars of
his time, among whom were Professors Crevier of Paris,
Breittinger of Zurich, and Matth. Gesner of Göttingen.
From each of these learned men he received such flattering
notice of the acuteness of his inquiries, as proved how
well he had employed the time and means at his command.
His first work, written in French, the “Essay
on the Study of Literature,” was produced at three-and-twenty,
after his laborious reading of the best English
and French, as well as Latin and Greek authors.</p>

<p>A transition was now made by him, from retired leisure
to active life. His father was made major of the
Hampshire Militia, himself captain of grenadiers, and
the regiment was called out on duty. He had to devote
two years and a half to this employ, and expresses considerable
discontent with his “wandering life of military
servitude;” but thus judiciously tempers his observations:
“In every state there exists, however, a balance
of good and evil. The habits of a sedentary life were
usefully broken by the duties of an active profession.”...
“After my foreign education, with my reserved
temper, I should long have continued a stranger to my
native country, had I not been shaken in this various scene
of new faces and new friends; had not experience forced
me to feel the characters of our leading men, the state
of parties, the forms of office, and the operation of our
civil and military system. In this peaceful service I
imbibed the rudiments and the language and science of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
tactics, which opened a new field of study and observation....
The discipline and evolutions of a modern
battalion gave me a clearer notion of the phalanx and
the legion; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers
has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.”</p>

<p>Let the young reader observe how, even when a purpose
is not as yet distinctly formed, the leading events
of life, as well as study, may be made by the regal mind
to bend and contribute to the realising of one. Our
great paramount duty is to husband time well, to let not
an hour glide uselessly, to go on extending our range
of knowledge, and resolving to act our part well, even
while we are in uncertainty as to what our part may
be. The seed well sown, the germs well watered, and a
useful harvest must result, though neither we, nor any
who look on, for a while, may be able to prophesy of the
quality or abundance of the grain, seeing it is but yet in
its growth. “From my early youth I aspired to the
character of an historian,” says Gibbon; “while I served
in the militia, before and after the publication of my
‘Essay,’ this idea ripened in my mind.”</p>

<p>Yet, he was for a time undecided as to a subject: the
Expedition of Charles the Eighth of France into Italy;
the Crusade of Cœur de Lion; the Barons’ Wars against
John and Henry the Third; the History of Edward the
Black Prince; Lives and comparisons of Henry the
Fifth and the Emperor Titus; the Life of Sir Philip Sidney,
of the Marquis of Montrose, of Raleigh—and other
subjects of high interest, but each and all inferior to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
one he at length undertook, and for which his studies
had all along peculiarly fitted him, successively attracted
his attention. Amidst the colossal ruins of the amphitheatre
of Titus, the idea at length was formed in his
mind of tracing the vicissitudes of Rome; and this idea
swelled until his conception extended to such a history
as should depicture the thousand years of change which
fill up the period between the reign of the Antonines and
the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks. Years of
laborious study and research were necessary to accomplish
this gigantic labour; but it was perfected, and
remains the grandest historic monument ever raised by
an Englishman. The recent investigations of Guizot
have more fully confirmed the fact of the minute and
careful inquiries of Gibbon, in bringing together the vast
and multifarious materials necessary for the accurate
completion of his design. His great work is, emphatically,
for strictness of statement, combined with such
comprehensiveness of subjects, for depth and clearness of
disquisition, and for splendour of style, one of the most
magnificent “Triumphs of Perseverance.”</p>

<p>And is the roll of these triumphs complete? Have
the labours of the past pretermitted the possibility of
equal victories in the future? Never, while the human
mind exists, can the catalogue of its successes be deemed
to have found a limit or an end. Immense fields of
history remain yet untrodden and uncultivated; innumerable
facts throughout the ages which are gone
remain to be collected by industry and arranged by
judgment; the ever-varying phases of human affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
offer perpetual material for new chronicle: let none who
meditates to devote his youth to historical inquiry, with
the meritorious resolve to distinguish his manhood by
some useful monument of solid thought, imagine that
his ground has been narrowed, but rather understand
that it has been cleared and enlarged by the noble workmen
who have gone before.</p>

<p>Neither let the young and gifted, in whom the kindlings
of creative genius are felt, listen to the dull voices
who say, “The last epic has been written—no more
great dramas shall be produced—the lyrics of the past
will never be equalled!” If such vaticinations were
true, it would show that the human mind was dwarfed.
Shakspere did not believe that, or he would not have
excelled Sophocles. None but intellectual cravens will
affright themselves with the belief that they cannot
equal the doings of those who have gone before. True
courage says, “The laurel is never sere: its leaves are
evergreen. The laurels have not all been won: they
flourish still, in abundance. The bright examples of the
past shall not deter, but cheer me. I will go on to
equal them. My life, like the lives of the earth’s truly
great, shall be devoted to thought, to research—to deep
converse with the mighty spirits who still live in their
works, though their clay is dissolved; I will prepare to
build, and build carefully and wisely, as they built; I
also will rear my lasting memorial among “The Triumphs
of Perseverance!”</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="center no-indent">CANOVA.—CHANTREY.—SALVATOR ROSA.—BENJAMIN
WEST.</p>


<p class="no-indent">If a rude image of the South Sea islanders be compared
with one of Chantrey’s sculptures, or a Chinese picture
with some perfect performance of Raffaelle or Claude,
what a world of reflection unfolds itself on the countless
steps taken by the mind, from its first attempt at imitating
the human form, or depicturing a landscape, to the
periods of its most successful effort in statuary or painting.
The first childish essay of a great artist, compared
with one of the masterpieces of his maturity, calls up
kindred thoughts. How often must the eye re-measure
an object; how often retrace the direction or inclination
of the lines by which a figure is bounded; what an infinite
number of comparisons must perception store up in
the memory, as to the resemblance of one form to
another; what repeated scrutiny must the judgment
exercise over what most delights the ideal faculty, till
the source of delight—the harmony arising from combination
of forms—be discovered and understood; and
how unweariedly must the intellect return, again and
again, to these its probationary labours, before the capability
for realising great triumphs in Art be attained.</p>

<p>Doubtless, the mind of a young artist, like the mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
under any other process of training, exercises many of
these acts with little self-consciousness; but observation
and comparison have, inevitably, to be practised, and
their results to be stored up in the mind, before the
hand can be directed and employed in accurate delineation
and embodiment of forms. Without diligence in
this training, the chisel of Chantrey would have failed to
bring more life-like shapes from a block of marble than
the knife of a Sandwich islander carves out of the trunk
of a tree; and the canvas of Claude would have failed as
utterly to realise proportion, and sunlight, and distance,
as a piece of porcelain figured and coloured by a native
of China. As it is in the elaboration of Literature’s
most perfect products so it is in Art: into the mind his
images must be taken; there they must be wrought up
into new combinations and shapes of beauty or of power;
and from this grand repository the statuary or painter,
like the poet, must summon his forms anew, evermore
returning, dutifully, to compare them with Nature and
actual life, and sparing no effort to clothe them with the
attribute of veri-similitude.</p>

<p>Need it be argued, then, that without <em>perseverance</em>
the world would have beheld none of the wonders of high
Art? If the mind, by her own mysterious power, have,
first, to pencil the forms of the outward upon her tablets
within; if she have, then, a greater work of combination
and creation to perform, ere a statue or a picture
of the ideal can be realised; if the hand, in a word, can
only successfully carve, limn, and colour, from the pattern
laid up in the wealth of the trained and experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
mind, how absolute the necessity for perseverance to
enrich and perfect that mind which is to direct the
hand! That neglect of this evident truth has marked
the lives of unsuccessful artists may, too often, be seen
in the records of them: while the deepest conviction of
a duty to obey its dictates has distinguished the world’s
most glorious names in painting and sculpture. Let us
glance at the steps taken by a few of these, in their way
to <em>triumphs</em>; not unheedful, meanwhile, how their exhibition
of the great moral quality of perseverance enabled
them to trample on the difficulties of actual life, as
well as to overcome obstacles in their progress to perfect
art.</p>

<h3>ANTONIA CANOVA,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">The greatest of modern sculptors, was born in a mud-walled
cabin of an Alpine valley within the Venetian
territories; and remained in the care of Pasino, his
grandfather, who was a stone-cutter, till his twelfth year.
Pasino, evermore employing enticement and tenderness
rather than compulsion began to instruct the child in
drawing, as soon as his little hand could hold a pencil;
and even taught him to model in clay at an early age.
At nine years old, however, he was set to work at stone-cutting;
and, thenceforward, his essays in art were but
pursued as relaxations. Yet his boyish performances
were sufficiently remarkable to attract notice from the
chief of the patrician family of Falieri, for whom Pasino
worked. This nobleman took young Canova under his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
patronage, and placed him with Toretto, a sculptor.
His new preceptor was not very liberal in his instructions;
but the young genius secretly pursued his high
bent, and one day surprised Toretto by producing the
figures of two angels of singular beauty. His yearnings
after excellence, at this period, grew vast; but were indefinite.
He often became disgusted with what he had
done; and to fitful dreams of beauty in Art succeeded
moods of despair; but he invariably returned to his
models, imperfect as he perceived them to be, and resolved
to labour on from the point of his present knowledge
up to the mastery he coveted.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="i_b_048" style="max-width: 44.9375em;">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>On the death of Toretto, in Canova’s fifteenth year,
Falieri removed the aspiring boy to Venice. He was
lodged in his patron’s palace; but was too truly a man,
in spite of his youth, to brook entire dependence on
another, and formed an engagement to work during the
afternoons for a sculptor in the city. “I laboured for
a mere pittance, but it was sufficient,” is the language
of one of his letters. “It was the fruit of my own resolution;
and, as I then flattered myself, the foretaste
of more honourable rewards—for I never thought of
wealth.” Under successive masters, Canova acquired a
knowledge of what were then held to be the established
rules of sculpture, but made no important essay, except
his Eurydice, which was of the size of nature, and had
“great merit” in the estimation of his patron, although
Canova himself thought not so highly of it. Indeed, his
genius was preparing to break away from the mannerism
of his instructors almost as soon as it was learnt. The
works of Bernini, Algardi, and other comparatively inferior
artists, were then taken for models rather than the
Apollo, the Laocoon, the Venus, or the Gladiator—the
transcendent remains of ancient statuary. “The unaffected
majesty of the antique,” observes Mr. Mernes,
Canova’s English biographer, was then “regarded as
destitute of force and impression.” And as for Nature,
“her simplicity was then considered as poverty, devoid
of elegance or grace.” Nature, therefore, was not
imitated by this school of sculptors; but, in the critical
language of one of their own countrymen, she was but
“translated according to conventional modes.” Canova<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
spurned subjection to the trammels of corrupt taste;
and, after deep thought, his resolve was taken, and he
entered on a new and arduous path. He thenceforth
“took Nature as the text, and formed the commentary
from his own elevated taste, fancy, and judgment.”</p>

<p>The exhibition of his Orpheus, the companion-statue
to his Eurydice, in his twentieth year, gave commencement
to Canova’s success and reputation, and proved the
devotion with which he had applied himself to the study of
the anatomy of life, to whatever he observed to be striking
in the attitudes of living men, in the expression of
their countenances, in “the sculpture of the heart.” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Il
scolpir del cuore</i>), as he so beautifully termed it. His
style was foreign to prevailing false taste; but it was so
true to Nature that its excellence won him general admiration.</p>

<p>Rome, the great capital of Art, naturally became the
theatre of his ambition at this period; and, soon after
his twenty-third birthday, he enters on his career in
the Eternal City, under the patronage of the Venetian
ambassador, obtained through Falieri’s friendship. With
rapture he beheld a mass of marble, which had cost what
would equal sixty-three pounds sterling, arrive at the
ambassador’s palace, as an assurance that he would have
the material for accomplishing a great work he had devised.
Yet, with an overawed sense of the perfection he
now saw in the remains of ancient sculpture, and believing
himself deficient in the conception of ideal beauty,
he studied deeply and worked in secret, shutting himself
up in a room of the ambassador’s palace, after each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
daily visit to the grand galleries. His Theseus and
Minotaur was, at length, shown; and he was considered
to have placed himself at the head of living sculptors.</p>

<p>Ten successive years of his life, after this triumph,
were devoted to funeral monuments of the Popes Clement
the Fourteenth (Ganganelli), and Clement the Twelfth
(Rezzonico). “They were,” says his biographer, “years
of unceasing toil and solicitude, both as the affairs of the
artist did not permit of having recourse to the assistance
of inferior workmen, and as he meditated technical improvements
and modes of execution unknown to contemporaries.
Much valuable time was thus lost to all the
nobler purposes of study, while the conducting from
their rude and shapeless state to their final and exquisite
forms such colossal masses was no less exhausting to
the mind than to the body. The method, however,
which was now first adopted, and subsequently perfected,
not only allowed, in future, exclusive attention to the
higher provinces of art, but enabled this master to produce
a greater number of original works than any other
of modern times can boast.” These observations show
Canova to have been one of the noblest disciples of perseverance;
slighting the readier triumphs he might have
won, by exerting his skill with the customary appliances,
he aimed to invent methods whereby gigantic works in
art might be more readily achieved, both by himself and
his successors: he prescribed for himself the work of a
discoverer, and he magnanimously toiled till he succeeded.</p>

<p>Canova’s most perfect works were, of course, accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
in his full manhood. These were his Cupid and
Psyche, Venus, Perseus, Napoleon, Boxers, and Hercules
and Lichas: creations which have made so truthfully applicable
to his glorious genius the immortal line of Byron:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Europe, the world, has but one Canova.”</div>
  </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Titles of honour were showered on him during his latter
years; among the rest that of “Marquis of Ischia;” but
he esteemed all of them as inferior to the triumph of his
advocacy for the restoration of the precious works of
ancient art to Italy. He was commissioned by the Pope
for this undertaking, and his great name will be imperishably
united with the memory of its success.</p>

<p>To all who are commencing the struggle of life the
moral course of Canova demands equally close imitation,
with his persevering zeal in the attainment of artistic
excellence. He ever refused pecuniary dependence; subjected
himself to great disadvantages in carrying out his
designs, rather than submit to such dependence; and
when a pension of three thousand crowns was conferred
upon him, towards the close of his career, he refused to
apply any portion of it to his own gratification of a personal
kind, and systematically devoted it, yearly, to premiums
for young competitors in art, instruction of scholars
in painting and sculpture, and pensions for poor and
decayed artists. Young reader, let the words of Canova,
on his death-bed, sink deeply into your mind, that they
may actuate your whole life as fully and nobly as they
actuated his own:—“First of all we ought to do our own
duty; but—<em>first of all</em>!”</p>

<h3>CHANTREY,</h3>

</figure>

<p class="no-indent">The most eminent of our sculptors, was another noble
example of successful perseverance. From a boy, accustomed
to drive an ass laden with sand into Sheffield,
he rose to the highest honours of an exalted profession;
a large proportion of the persons of rank and distinction
in his own time sat to him for busts and statues:
he was knighted, and, like Canova, left considerable
wealth at his death, to be devoted through future time
to the encouragement of Art. His father, who was a
small farmer in the neighbourhood of Sheffield, wished
to place him with a grocer or an attorney; but, at his
own urgent desire, he was apprenticed with a carver
and gilder in that town. An engraver and portrait-painter,
perceiving his devotion to Art, gave him some
valuable instruction; but his master did not incline to
forward his favourite pursuits, fearing they would interfere
with his duties as an apprentice. Young Chantrey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
however, resolved not to be defeated in his aims, and
hired a room for a few pence a week, secretly making it
his studio. His apprenticeship to the carver and gilder
having expired, he advertised in Sheffield to take portraits
in crayons; and two years afterwards announced
that he had commenced taking models from the life.
Like Canova, but untaught, he began to model in clay
when a child; and, at two-and-twenty, he thus began to
realise his early bent. Yet patronage was but scanty at
Sheffield, and he successively visited Dublin, Edinburgh,
and London, working as a modeller in clay. But
neither in these larger arenas of merit did he immediately
succeed according to his wish. Returning to
Sheffield, he modelled four busts of well-known characters
there as large as life, one of them being the
likeness of the lately-deceased vicar. This was a performance
of such excellence that he was offered a commission,
by a number of the deceased clergyman’s
friends, to execute a monument to the same reverend
personage for the parish church. Chantrey had never
yet lifted chisel to marble; and it, therefore, required
all the courage which consciousness of genius alone
could give to undertake such a task. It was the great
turning point of his life. He accepted the commission,
employed a marble mason to rough-hew the block, set
about the completion himself, and finished it most successfully.
Thenceforward his course was open to the
excellence he displayed in giving life-like expression to
historic portraits, as in his marble statue of Watt in
Westminster Abbey, and his bronze statue of Pitt in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Hanover Square; and, above all, in infusing poetry
into marble, as in his exquisite sculpture of the Lady
Louisa Russell at Woburn Abbey, and his unsurpassed
group, “the Sleeping Children,” in Lichfield cathedral.</p>

<p>In the lives of the great Michael Angelo himself, of
Benvenuto Cellini, and others, may also be found inspiring
records of the tameless and tireless energy which has
secured to us many of the great triumphs of sculpture.

<h3>SALVATOR ROSA,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="i_b_056" style="max-width: 47.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_056.jpg" alt="Salvator Rosa">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">One of those high names which are everlasting monuments
of the success with which true genius bids
defiance to the hostilities of poverty and envy might be
claimed, with pride and fondness, by either of the sister
arts of Poetry and Music, were it not that his greatest
triumphs were won in Painting. The wildness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
sublimity of his canvas had their types in the scenery
of his birth-place—the ancient and decayed villa of
Renella, within view of Mount Vesuvius, and near to
Naples. His father was a poverty-stricken artist, and
descended from a family to whom poverty and painting
had been heirlooms for generations. Determined to
avert the continuance of this inauspicious union of
inheritances in the life of his child, he took counsel
with his wife, and they resolved to dedicate him to the
service of the Church. He was, accordingly, taken to
the font in the grand church pertaining to the “Monks
of the Certosa,” and piously named “Salvatore,” as a
sign and seal of the religious life to which his parents
had vowed to devote him. But the method they took
to bind him down to religious lessons was not wise,
though their meaning was no doubt good; and the
boyish Rosa often became a truant, wandered away for
days among the rocks and trees, and frequently slept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
out in the open air of that beautiful climate. His worship
of the sublime scenery with which he thus became
familiar was soon evinced in the fidelity of numerous
sketches of picturesque he drew upon the walls of one
of the rooms in the large old house his father inhabited.
Unchecked by the reprehension of his parents, who
dreaded nothing more than the event of their child
becoming an artist, he one day entered the monastery
of the Certosa, with his burnt sticks in his hand—his
only instruments of design—and began, secretly and
silently, to scrawl his wild sketches upon such vacant
spaces as he could find, on walls that abounded in the
most splendid decorations of gold and vermilion and
ultra-marine. The monks caught him at his daring
labour, and inflicted upon him a severe whipping; but
neither did this subdue his thirst to become an artist.</p>

<p>The perplexity of Salvator’s parents was now very
great, and they saw no chance of restraining the wayward
spirit of their boy but in confiding him to other
tutelage; not reflecting that he had displayed talents
which it was peculiarly in their own power to direct
and foster into a perfection, the result of which might
have been their own relief and their child’s happiness.
He was, at length, sent to a monastic school; and “Salvatoriello,”
the nickname his restlessness and ingenious
caprices had gained him, was thenceforth clad in the
long gown of a monk, in common with his young schoolfellows.
Repulsive as confinement might prove to his
vehement disposition, it was at this period that his
mind received the solid culture which enabled it to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
claims to literary distinction at a future time. So
long as his lessons were confined to Homer, Horace,
and Sallust, he manifested no disquiet in his restraint;
but when the day came that he must enter on the subtleties
of the scholastic philosophy, all his youthful
rebelliousness against the forced and injudicious religious
tasks imposed on him by his own parents rose up, and
he was expelled the school of the monastery for contumacy.
The grief of his father and mother, at beholding
their boy, in his sixteenth year, thus sent back in disgrace
to his indigent home, may be easily conjectured.
Yet this heavier disaster does not, in the slightest
degree, appear to have opened their eyes, as to the want
of judgment they had displayed in their child’s training:
the mother grew increasingly passionate in her
desire that “Salvatoriello” should be a churchman; and
the father resolved, let the cast-out schoolboy take whatever
stamp he might, he should not, by his parents’
help, become a painter.</p>

<p>The occurrence of his eldest sister’s marriage to Francanzani,
a painter of considerable genius, opened, in
another year, the way for Salvator’s instruction in the
art to which nature so strongly inclined him. He had
already essayed his powers in poetry and music, having
composed several lyrics, and set them to airs dictated
by his own imagination, feeling, and taste. These were
great favourites with the crowds of Naples, and were
daily sung by the women who sat to knit in the sunshine.
His devotion to the composition of canzonets
was, however, ardently shared with the novel lessons of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
the studio, as soon as the house of his sister’s husband
was opened to him for an asylum from the harshness of
his parental home. To the teaching of Francanzani
he speedily added the copying of nature in the wilds of
his truant childhood: and often, when he returned from
the mountains with his primed paper full of sketches,
his teacher would pat him on the shoulder encouragingly,
and say, “Rub on, rub on, Salvatoriello—that is
good!” The great painter often related to his friends,
in the after days of his fame, what energy he had derived
from those simple words of friendly approbation.</p>

<p>Having learnt the elements of his profession, the
young Rosa set out to take his <em>giro</em>, according to the
custom of all young painters at that period. He did
not, however, take his way through the cities of Italy
most famous for their galleries of Art, like other youthful
artists; but yielding to the bent of his natural
genius struck up, adventurously, into the mountains of
the Abruzzi and the wilds of Calabria. Here he was
taken prisoner by banditti, and suffered great hardships.
Whether he escaped from them, or was, in the end,
liberated, is not clear; but when he returned to Naples,
his mind was full of the wondrous pictures of wild volcanic
and forest scenery, and striking forms and features
of mountain robbers, which he, forthwith, began to
realise.</p>

<p>New and more severe difficulties than he had ever yet
had to encounter fell to his lot, at his return. His
father died in his arms; a few days after, his brother-in-law,
Francanzani, was overwhelmed with poverty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Salvator was left to struggle for the support of his
mother and sisters. Yet his strong spirit did not sink.
He laid aside music and poetry, and although too poor
to purchase canvas, began to depict his wild conceptions
on primed paper; and, at night, used to steal out and
sell his sketches to some shrewd Jew chapman for a vile
price. His gains were pitiful, but he strove, by redoubled
industry, to swell their amount for a sufficient
supply of the family’s necessities.</p>

<p>An accident served to bring into notice the genius
whose high merit had hitherto met with no public
recognition. Lanfranco, the artist who, with the courtly
Spagnuoletto, shared the patronage of the rich in Naples,
stopped his equipage, one day, in the “Street of Charity,”
and called for a picture to be brought to him
which arrested his eye in the collection of one of the
<em>rivendotori</em>, or second-hand dealers. It was a masterly
sketch of “Hagar in the Wilderness,” and the obscure
name of “Salvatoriello” was subscribed at the corner
of it. Lanfranco gave orders that all sketches which
could be found bearing that name should be bought for
him. Rosa immediately raised his prices; but, although
this high acknowledgment of his merit brought him the
acquaintance of several influential names in his profession,
he was speedily so deeply disgusted with the jealousy
and envy of others, that he strapped all his
fortune to his back, and at the age of twenty set out
on foot to seek better treatment at Rome. There he
studied energetically, worshipping, above all, the kindred
genius of Michael Angelo; but meeting with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
renewal of neglect, and taking a fever from the malaria,
once more returned to Naples. The misery in which
his family was plunged was still greater than at his departure;
and another period of keen life-combat followed.
This repeated struggle did not depress him;
but it gave his mind that bitter tendency which he afterwards
displayed in his poetical “Satires.”</p>

<p>At twenty-four, under the humble patronage of a
domestic of the Cardinal Brancaccia, he again went to
Rome; and through the friendship of the same plain
acquaintance had a large and lonely apartment provided
for him, as a studio, in the cardinal’s palace. Dependence
nevertheless revolted his lofty spirit, and he
again returned to Naples, but engaged to send his pictures
to his friend for public exposure in Rome. His
“Prometheus” was the first of his pictures exhibited at
one of the annual shows in the Pantheon, and the
public voice adjudged it to be the greatest. He obeyed
a renewed invitation to Rome, but it was still to meet
with disappointment. The next carnival furnished his
versatile genius with an occasion for winning, by humorous
stratagem, the attention denied to his more
sterling merit. He put on a mask, and played the
charlatan and <em>improvisatore</em> in the public streets, among
a crowd of such exhibitors as abound in Rome at such
seasons; but soon eclipsed them all by the splendour
of his wit. Curiosity was raised to the highest pitch,
at the close of the carnival, respecting the identity of
this unequalled exhibitor; and when he was proclaimed
to be the painter of the “Prometheus” the admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
was unbounded. Salvator, now, for some successive
months, gave himself up to conversaziones, wherever
invited; and there, by his wit, his lute, and canzonettes,
paved the way for his greater acceptance as a painter.</p>

<p>Jealousy, in that age of corrupt patronage and jealous
artists, still pursued him; but his genius, thenceforth,
rose above all opposition. His landscapes were in every
palace, and he soon rose to affluence. Yet the remainder
of his life was chequered with difficulties into which the
vehemence of his nature perpetually plunged him. That
nature was unsubduable amidst all vicissitudes. The
magnificent creations of his “Socrates swallowing Poison,”
“Purgatory,” “Prodigal Son,” “St. Jerome,”
“Babilonia,” and “Conspiracy of Catiline,” with an
almost innumerable catalogue of lesser pieces, flowed
from his pencil, during a life alternately marked by
devotion to each of the sister Arts, and, during one portion
of it, to political contest—for he flew to Naples, with
all the ardour of patriotism, and joined Masaniello, in
his sincere but short-lived effort to rescue his countrymen
from a crushing despotism. His participation in
the celebrated fisherman’s conspiracy placed him in danger
of the Inquisition on his return to Rome; but, on
retiring to Florence, he became the favourite of the
Grand Duke, Cosmo the Third, and entered on a career
of opulent success, which attended him to the end of
life.</p>

<p>The life-passages of Salvator Rosa, by injudicious
thwarting of his nature, were rendered thorny beyond those
of the great majority of men, and the amazing versatility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of his talents, combined with almost volcanic ardour of
spirit, defied common rules; but the strength of his
judgment so completely gave him the victory over influences
that might have destroyed him, as to lead him to
seek the memorable “Triumphs of Perseverance” he
secured by his supreme devotion to that Art, in which
there is reckoned no greater name for sublimity and
originality, and none of greater general excellence than
those of Raffaelle and Michael Angelo. Let the brief
sketch of Salvator Rosa be compared with the much more
“even tenor” of the life of another, that it may be seen
how clearly, in spite of contrast, many of the same valuable
lessons are deducible from it.</p><br>

<h3>BENJAMIN WEST,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_064" style="max-width: 42.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_064.jpg" alt="Benjamin West">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">An American Quaker by birth, was the youngest of a
family of ten children, and was nurtured with great
tenderness and care; a prophecy uttered by a preacher
of the sect having impressed his parents with the belief
that their child would, one day, become a great man.
In what way the prophecy was to be realised they had
formed to themselves no definite idea; but an incident,
which occurred in young West’s sixth year, led his father
to ponder deeply as to whether its fulfilment were not
begun. Benjamin, being left to watch the infant child
of one of his relatives while it was left asleep in the
cradle, had drawn its smiling portrait, in red and black
ink, there being paper and pens on the table in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
room. This spontaneous and earliest essay of his genius
was so strikingly truthful that it was instantly and rapturously
recognised by the family. During the next
year he drew flowers and birds with pen and ink; but a
party of Indians, coming on a visit to the neighbourhood,
taught him to prepare and use red and yellow ochre and
indigo. Soon after, he heard of camel-hair pencils, and
the thought seized him that he could make use of a substitute,
so he plucked hairs from the tail of a black cat
that was kept in the house, fashioned his new instrument,
and began to lay on colours, much to his boyish satisfaction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
In the course of another year a visitant friend,
having seen his pictures, sent him a box of colours, oils,
and pencils, with some pieces of prepared canvas and a
few engravings. Benjamin’s fascination was now indescribable.
The seductions presented by his new means of
creation were irresistible, and he played truant from
school for some days, stealing up into a garret, and
devoting the time, with all the throbbing wildness of
delight, to painting. The schoolmaster called, the truant
was sought, and found in the garret by his mother.
She beheld what he had done; and instead of reprehending
him fell on his neck and kissed him, with tears
of ecstatic fondness. How different from the training
experienced by the poor, persecuted and tormented
“Salvatoriello!” What wonder, that the fiery-natured
Italian afterwards drew human nature with a severe
hand; and how greatly might his vehement disposition
have been softened, had his nurture resembled that of
the child of these gentle Quakers!</p>

<p>The friend who had presented him with the box of
colours some time after took him to Philadelphia,
where he was introduced to a painter, saw his pictures,
the first he had ever seen except his own, and wept with
emotion at the sight of them. Some books on Art increased
his attachment to it; and some presents enabled
him to purchase materials for further exercises. Up to
his eighteenth year, strange as the facts seem, he received
no instruction in painting, had to carve out his entire
course himself, and yet advanced so far as to create his
first historical picture, “The Death of Socrates,” and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
execute portraits for several persons of taste. His father,
however, had never yet assisted him; for, with all his
ponderings on the preacher’s prophecy, he could not
shake off some doubts respecting the lawfulness of the
profession of a painter, to which no one of the conscientious
sect had ever yet devoted himself. A counsel of
“Friends” was therefore called together, and the perplexed
father stated his difficulty and besought their
advice. After deep consideration, their decision was
unanimous that the youth should be permitted to pursue
the objects to which he was now both by nature and
habit attached; and young Benjamin was called in, and
solemnly set apart by the primitive brethren for his chosen
profession. The circumstances of this consecration
were so remarkable, that, coupled with the early prophecy
already mentioned, they made an impression on West’s
mind that served to strengthen greatly his resolution for
advancement in Art, and for devotion to it as his supreme
object through life.</p>

<p>On the death of his affectionate mother he finally left
his father’s house, and, not being yet nineteen, set up in
Philadelphia as a portrait-painter, and soon found plenty
of employment. For the three or four succeeding years
he worked unremittingly, making his second essay at
historic painting within that term, but labouring at portraits,
chiefly with the view of winning the means to enable
himself to visit Italy. His desire was at length
accomplished, a merchant of New York generously presenting
him with fifty guineas as an additional outfit, and
thus assisting him to reach Rome without the uneasiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
that would have arisen from straitness of means in a
strange land.</p>

<p>The appearance of a Quaker artist of course caused
great excitement in the metropolis of Art; crowds of
wonderers were formed around him; but, when in the
presence of the great relics of Grecian genius, he was
the wildest wonderer of all. “How like a young Mohawk!”
he exclaimed, on first seeing the “Apollo
Belvidere,” its life-like perfection bringing before his
mind, instantaneously, the free forms of the desert
children of Nature in his native America. The excitement
of little more than one month in Rome threw him
into a dangerous illness, from which it was some time
before he recovered. He visited the other great cities of
Italy, and also painted and exhibited two great historical
pictures, which were successful, ere the three years were
completed which he stayed in that country. He would
have returned to Philadelphia; but a letter from his
father recommended him first to visit England.</p>

<p>West’s success in London was speedily so decided, that
he gave up all thoughts of returning to America. For
thirty years of his life he was chiefly employed in executing,
for King George the Third, the great historical
and scriptural pictures which now adorn Windsor Palace
and the Royal Chapel. After the abrupt termination of
the commission given him by the King, he continued
still to be a laborious painter. His pictures in oil
amount to about four hundred, and many of them are of
very large dimensions and contain a great number of
figures. Among these may be mentioned, for its wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
celebrity, the representation of “Christ healing the Sick,”
familiar to every visitor of the National Gallery. If
polished taste be more highly charmed with other treasures
there, the heart irresistibly owns the excellence of
this great realisation by the child of the American Quaker.
He received three thousand guineas for this picture,
and his rewards were of the most substantial kind ever
after his settlement in England. He was also appointed
President of the Royal Academy, on the death of Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and held the office at his own death,
in the eighty-second year of his age.</p>

<p>Though exposed to no opposition from envy or jealousy
at any time of his career, and though encouraged in his
childish bent, and helped by all who knew him and had
the power to help him, without Perseverance of the most
energetic character Benjamin West would not have continued
without pattern or instruction to labour on to
excellence, nor would he have sustained his prosperity
so firmly, or increased its productiveness so wondrously.</p>

<h3>HANDEL.</h3>

<p class="no-indent">The time may come when Music will be universally recognised
as the highest branch of Art; as the most
powerful divulger of the intellect’s profoundest conceptions
and noblest aspirations; as the truest interpreter
of the heart’s loves and hates, joys and woes; as the
purest, least sensual, disperser of mortal care and sorrow;
as the all-glorious tongue in which refined, good, and
happy beings can most perfectly utter their thoughts
and emotions. Perhaps this cannot be till the realm of
the physical world be more fully subdued by man. The
human faculties have hitherto been, necessarily, too
much occupied with the struggle for existence, for security
against want and protection from the elements, with
the invention of better and swifter modes of locomotion
and of transmission of thought, to advance to a general
apprehension of the superior nature of Music. “Practical
men”—men fitted for the discharge of the world’s
present duties by the manifestation of the readiest and
fullest capacity for meeting its present wants—are,
naturally and justly, those whom the world most highly
values in its current state of civilisation.</p>

<p>This necessary preference of the practical to the ideal
may lead many, who cannot spare a thought from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
every-day concerns of the world, to deem hastily that
the stern and energetic quality of Perseverance cannot
be fully developed in the character of a devotee to Music.
But, dismissing the greater question just hinted at, it
may be replied that it is the evident tendency of man to
form the lightest pleasures of the mind, as well as his
gravest discoveries, into what is called “science;” and
the lives of numerous musicians show that vast powers
of application have been continuously devoted to the
elaboration of the rules of harmony, while others have
employed their genius as ardently in the creation of
melody. These creations, when the symbols are learnt
in which they are written, the mind, by its refined exorcism,
can enable the voice, or the hand of the instrumental
performer, to summon into renewed existence to
the end of time. Before symbols were invented and
rules constructed, the wealth of Music must necessarily
have been restricted to a few simple airs such as the
memory could retain and easily reproduce. <em>Perseverance</em>—<em>Perseverance</em>—has
guided and sinewed men’s love
of the beautiful and powerful in melody and harmony,
until, from the simple utterance of a few notes of feeling,
rudely conveyed from sire to son by renewed utterance,
Music has grown up into a science, dignified and adorned
by profound theorists, like Albrechtsberger, and by sublime
creative geniuses, such as the majestic Handel and
sweetest Haydn and universal Mozart and sublime
Beethoven.</p>

<p>For their successful encounter of the great “battle
of life,” a hasty thinker would also judge that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
extreme susceptibility of musicians must unfit them;
extreme susceptibility, which is, perhaps, more peculiarly
their inheritance than it is that even of poets. Yet the
records of the lives of musical men prove, equally with
the biographies of artists, authors, and linguists, that
true genius, whatever may be the object of its high
devotion, is unsubduable by calamity and opposition. The
young inquirer will find ample proof of this in various
biographies: our limits demand that we confine ourselves
to one musician, as an exemplar of the grand attribute
of Perseverance.</p>

<h3>GEORGE FREDERICK HANDEL,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_071" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_071.jpg" alt="George Frederick Handel">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">The first of the four highest names in Music, was the
son of a physician of Halle, in Lower Saxony, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
designed by his father for the study of the civil law.
The child’s early attachment to music—for he could
play well on the old instrument called a clavichord
before he was seven years old—was, therefore, witnessed
by his parent with great displeasure. Unable to resist
the dictates of his nature, the boy used to climb up into
a lonely garret, shut himself up, and practise, chiefly
when the family were asleep. He attached himself so
diligently to the practice of his clavichord, that it enabled
him, without ever having received the slightest
instruction, to become an expert performer on the harpsichord.
It was at this early age that the resolution of
young Handel was manifested in the singular incident
often told of his childhood. His father set out in a
chaise to go and visit a relative who was valet-de-chambre
to the Duke of Saxe-Weisenfels, but refused to
admit the boy as a partner in his journey. After the
carriage, however, the boy ran, kept closely behind it
for some miles, unconquerable in his determination to
proceed, and was at last taken into the chaise by his
father. When arrived, it was impossible to keep him
from the harpsichords in the duke’s palace; and, in the
chapel, he contrived to get into the organ-loft, and
began to play with such skill on an instrument he had
never before touched, that the duke, overhearing him,
was surprised, asked who he was, and then used every
argument to induce the father to make the child a
musician, and promised to patronise him.</p>

<p>Overcome by the reasonings of this influential personage,
the physician gave up the thought of thwarting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
his child’s disposition: and, at their return to Halle,
placed young Handel under the tuition of Zackau, the
organist of the cathedral. The young “giant”—a designation
afterwards so significantly bestowed upon him
by Pope—grew up so rapidly into mastery of the instrument,
that he was soon able to conduct the music of the
cathedral in the organist’s absence; and, at nine years
old, composed church services both for voices and instruments.
At fourteen he excelled his master; and his
father resolved to send him, for higher instruction, to a
musical friend who was a professor at Berlin. The
opera then flourished in that city more highly than in
any other in Germany; the king marked the precocious
genius of the young Saxon, and offered to send him into
Italy for still more advantageous study: but his father,
who was now seventy years old, would not consent to
his leaving his “fatherland.”</p>

<p>Handel next went to Hamburgh, where the opera was
only little inferior to Berlin. His father died soon
after; and, although but in his fourteenth year, the
noble boy entered the orchestra as a salaried performer,
took scholars, and thus not only secured his own independent
maintenance, but sent frequent pecuniary help
to his mother. How worshipfully the true children of
Genius blend their convictions of moral duty with the
untiring aim to excel!</p>

<p>On the resignation of Keser, composer to the opera,
and first harpsichord in Hamburgh, a contest for the
situation took place between Handel and the person
who had hitherto been Keser’s second. Handel’s decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
superiority of skill secured him the office, although
he was but fifteen years of age; but his success had
nearly cost him his life, for his disappointed antagonist
made a thrust with a sword at his breast, where a music
book Handel had buttoned under his coat prevented the
entrance of the weapon. Numerous sonatas, three
operas, and other admired pieces, were composed during
Handel’s superintendence of the Hamburgh opera; but,
at nineteen, being invited by the brother of the Grand
Duke, he left that city for Tuscany. He received high
patronage at Florence, and afterwards visited Venice,
Rome, and Naples, residing, for shorter or longer periods,
in each city, producing numerous operas, cantatas, and
other pieces, reaping honours and rewards, and becoming
acquainted with Corelli, Scarletti, and other musicians;
till, after spending six years in Italy, he returned to
Germany.</p>

<p>Through the friendship of Baron Kilmansegg he was
introduced to the Elector of Hanover, was made “chapel-master”
to the court, and had a pension conferred upon
him of fifteen hundred crowns a year. In order to
secure the services of the “great musician,” as he was
acknowledged now to be, the King provided that he
should be allowed, at will, to be absent for a year at a
time. The very next year he took advantage of this
provision and set out for England, having first visited
his old master Zackau, and his aged and blind mother
for the last time—still true, amidst the dazzling influences
of his popularity, to the most correct emotions of
the heart!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>His opera of “Rinaldo” was performed with great
success during his stay in this country, and after one
year he returned to Hanover; yet his predilection for
England, above every other country he had seen, was so
strong, that after the lapse of another year he was again
in London. The peace of Utrecht occurred a few
months after his second arrival, and having composed a
Te Deum and Jubilate in celebration of it, and thereby
won such favour that Queen Anne was induced to solicit
his continuance in England, and to confer upon him a
pension of £200 a year, Handel resolved to forfeit his
Hanoverian pension, and made up his mind to remain
in London. But, two years afterwards, the Queen died,
and the great musician was now in deep dread that his
slight of the Elector’s favours would be resented by that
personage on becoming King of England. George the
First, indeed, expressed himself very indignantly respecting
Handel’s conduct; but the Baron Kilmansegg
again rendered his friend good service. He instructed
Handel to compose music of a striking character, to be
played on the water, as the King took amusement with
a gay company. Handel created his celebrated “Water
Music,” chiefly adapted for horns; and the effect was
so striking that the King was delighted. Kilmansegg
seized the opportunity, and sued for the restoration of
his friend to favour. The boon was richly obtained, for
Handel’s pension was raised to £400 per annum, and
he was appointed musical teacher to the young members
of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>Prosperity seemed to have selected Handel, up to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
period, for her favourite; but severe reverses were coming.
The opera in this country had hitherto been conducted
on worn-out and absurd principles, and a large
body of the people of taste united to promote a reform.
Rival opera-houses (as at the present period) were
opened; and during nine years Handel superintended
one establishment. It was one perpetual quarrel: when
his opponents, by any change, had become so feeble
that he seemed on the eve of a final triumph, one or
other of the singers in his own company would grow
unmanageable: Senesino was the chief of these, and
Handel’s refusal to accept the mediation of several of
the nobility, and be reconciled to him, caused the establishment
over which he presided to be finally broken up.
The great powers of Farinelli, the chief singer at the
rival house, to whom an equal could not then be found
in Europe, also largely contributed to Handel’s ruin.
He withdrew, with a loss of ten thousand pounds; his
constitution seemed completely broken with the years
of harassment he had experienced; and he retired to
the baths of Aix-la-Chapelle, scarcely with the hope,
on the part of his friends, that they would ever see him
in England again.</p>

<p>His paralysis and other ailments, however, disappeared
with wondrous suddenness; after he reached the medical
waters, he recovered full health and vigour, and, at the
age of fifty-two, returned to England with the manly
resolve to struggle till he had paid his debts, and once
more retrieved a fortune equal to his former condition.
It was now that the whole strength of the man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
tried. He produced his “Alexander’s Feast;” but, in
spite of its acknowledged merit, the nobility whom he
had offended would not patronise him. He produced
other pieces, but they failed from the same cause. He
then bent his mighty genius on the creation of newer
and grander attractions than had ever been yet introduced
in music, and produced his unequalled “Messiah,”
which was performed at Covent Garden during Lent.
Yet the combination against him was maintained, until
he sunk into deeper difficulties than ever.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_077" style="max-width: 37.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_077.jpg" alt="George Frederick Handel">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Unsubdued by the failures which had accumulated
around him during the five years which had elapsed
since his return to England, he set out for Ireland, at
fifty-seven, and had his “Messiah” performed in Dublin,
for the benefit of the city prison. His success was instantaneous;
several performances took place for his own
benefit, and the next year he renewed the war against
Fortune, in London, by producing his magnificent “Samson,”
and having it performed, together with his “Messiah,”
at Covent Garden. The first renewed performance
of the “Messiah” was for the benefit of the Foundling
Hospital; and the funds of that philanthropic institution
were thenceforth annually benefited by the repetition
of that sublime Oratorio. Prejudice was now subdued,
the “mighty master” triumphed, and his darling
wish for honourable independence was fully realised;
for more than he had lost was retrieved.</p>

<p>Handel’s greatest works, like those of Haydn, were
produced in his advanced years. His “Jephthah” was
produced at the age of sixty-seven. Paralysis returned
upon him at fifty-nine, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gutta serena</i>—Milton’s memorable
affliction—reduced him to “total eclipse” of
sight some years after: but he submitted cheerfully to
his lot, after brief murmuring, and continued, by dictation
to an amanuensis, the creation of new works, and
the performance of his Oratorios to the last. He conducted
his last Oratorio but a week before his death,
and died, as he had always desired to do, on Good
Friday, at the age of seventy-five. He was interred,
with distinguished honours, among the great and good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of that country which had naturalised him, in Westminster
Abbey. May the sight of his monument inspire
the young reader with an unquenchable zeal to emulate,
in whatever path wisdom may direct life to be passed,
the moral and intellectual excellencies of this glorious
disciple of Perseverance!</p>

<p class="no-indent">If great proficiency in tongues, skill to depicture human
thought and character, and enthusiastic devotion to art,
he worthy of our admiration, the toiling intelligences
who have taught us to subdue the physical world, and
to bring it to subserve our wants and wishes, claim
scarcely less homage. Art and literature could never
have sprung into existence if men had remained mere
strugglers for life, in their inability to contend with the
elements of nature, because ignorant of its laws; and
an acquaintance with the languages of tribes merely
barbarous would have been but a worthless kind of
knowledge. To scientific discoverers—the pioneers of
civilization, who make the world worth living in, and
render man’s tenancy of it more valuable by every successive
step of discovery—our primary tribute of admiration
and gratitude seems due. They are the grand
revealers of the physical security, health, plenty, and
means of locomotion, which give the mind vantage-ground
for its reach after higher refinement and purer
pleasures.</p>

<p>Should the common observation be urged, that many
of the most important natural discoveries have resulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
from accident, let it be remembered, that, but for the
existence of some of our race, more attentive than the
rest, Nature might still have spoken in vain, as she had
undoubtedly done to thousands before she found an intelligent
listener, in each grand instance of physical
discovery. Grant all the truth that may attach to the
observation just quoted, and yet the weighty reflection
remains—that it was only by men who, in the sailor’s
phrase, were “on the look-out,” that the revelations of
Nature were caught. The natural laws were in operation
for ages, but were undiscovered, because men guessed
rather than inquired, or lived on without heed to mark,
effort to comprehend, industry to register, and, above
all, without perseverance to proceed from step to step in
discovery, till entire truths were learnt. That these
have been the attributes of those to whom we owe the
rich boon of science, a rapid survey of some of their
lives will manifest.</p>

<h3>SIR HUMPHREY DAVY,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">The son of a wood carver of Penzance, was apprenticed
by his father to a surgeon and apothecary of that town,
and afterwards with another of the same profession, but
gave little satisfaction to either of his masters. Natural
philosophy had become his absorbing passion; and, even
while a boy, he dreamt of future fame as a chemist.
The rich diversity of minerals in Cornwall offered the
finest field for his empassioned inquiries; and he was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the habit of rambling alone for miles, bent upon his
yearning investigation into the wonders of Nature. In
his master’s garret, and with the assistance of such a
laboratory as he could form for himself from the phials
and gallipots of the apothecary’s shop, and the pots and
pans of the kitchen, he brought the mineral and other
substances he collected to the test. The surgeon of a
French vessel wrecked on the coast gave him a case of
instruments, among which was one that he contrived to
fashion into an air-pump, and he was soon enabled to
extend the range of his experiments; but the proper use
of many of the instruments was unknown to him.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_082" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_082.jpg" alt="James Watt. Sir Humphrey Davy.">
</figure>

<p>A fortunate accident brought him the acquaintanceship
of Davies Gilbert, an eminent man of science.
Young Davy was leaning one day on the gate of his
father’s house, when a friend, who was passing by with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Mr. Gilbert, said, “That is young Davy, who is so fond
of chemistry.” Mr. Gilbert immediately entered into
conversation with the youth, and offered him assistance
in his studies. By the kind offices of his new friend he
was afterwards introduced to Dr. Beddoes, who had
formed a pneumatic institution at Bristol, and was in
want of a superintendent for it. At the age of nineteen
Davy received this appointment, and immediately began
the splendid course of chemical discovery which has
rendered his name immortal as one of the greatest benefactors
as well as geniuses of the race.</p>

<p>At twenty-one he published his “Researches, Chemical
and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous Oxide,
and its respiration.” The singularly intoxicating quality
of this gas when breathed was unknown before Davy’s
publication of his experiments in this treatise. The
attention it drew upon him from the scientific world
issued in his being invited to leave Bristol, and take the
chair of chemistry which had just been established in
the London Royal Institution. Although but a youth
of two-and-twenty, his lectures in the metropolis were
attended by breathless crowds of men of science and
title; and, in another year, he was also appointed Professor
of Chemistry to the Board of Agriculture. His
lectures in that capacity greatly advanced chemical
knowledge, and were published at the request of the
Board. When twenty-five he was elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society, and, on the death of Sir Joseph
Banks, was made its President by a unanimous vote.
It was in the delivery of his Bakerian lectures, before this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
learned body, that he laid the foundation of the new science
called “electro-chemistry.” The Italians, Volta and
Galvani, had some years before discovered and made
known the surprising effects produced on the muscles of
dead animals by two metals being brought into contact
with each other. Davy showed that the metals underwent
chemical changes, not by what had been hitherto
termed “electricity,” but by affinity; and that the
same effects might be produced by one of the metals,
provided a fluid were brought to act on its surface in a
certain manner. The composition and decomposition of
substances by the application of the galvanic energy, as
displayed in the experiments of the young philosopher,
filled the minds of men of science with wonder.</p>

<p>His grand discoveries of the metallic bases of the
alkalies and earths, of the various properties of the
gases, and of the connexion of electricity and magnetism,
continued to absorb the attention of the scientific world
through succeeding years; but a simple invention,
whereby human life was rescued from danger in mines,
the region whence so great a portion of the wealth of
England is derived, placed him before the minds of
millions, learned and illiterate, as one of the guardians
of man’s existence. This was the well-known “safety
lamp,” an instrument which is provided at a trifling
expense, and with which the toiling miner can enter
subterranean regions unpierceable before, without danger
of explosion of the “fire-damp,” so destructive, before
this discovery, to the lives of thousands. The humblest
miner rejects any other name but that of “Davy Lamp”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
for this apparently insignificant protector; and ventures,
with it in his hand, cheerfully and boldly into the realms
of darkness, where the “black diamonds” lie so many
fathoms beneath the surface of the earth, and, not seldom,
under the bed of the sea. The proprietors of the
northern coal mines presented the discoverer with a
service of plate of the value of £2000, at a public
dinner, as a manifestation of their sense of his merits.
He was the first person knighted by the Prince Regent,
afterwards King George IV., and was a few years after
raised to the baronetage. Such honours served to mark
the estimation in which he was held by those who had
it in their power to confer them; but Davy’s enduring
distinctions, like those of the unequalled Newton, are
derived from the increase of power over nature, which he
has secured for millions yet unborn, by the force of his
genius, girt up, tirelessly by <em>Perseverance</em>, till its grand
triumphs were won.</p>

<p>From this hasty survey of the magnificent course of
one of the great penetrators into the secrets of nature,
and preservers of human life, let us cast a glance on the
struggles of one who has been the means of multiplying
man’s hands and fingers—to use a strong figure—of
opening up sources of employment for millions, and of
showing the road to wealth for thousands.</p>

<h3>SIR RICHARD ARKWRIGHT,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">Was a poor barber till the age of thirty, and then changed
his trade for that of an itinerant dealer in hair. Nothing
is known of any early attachment he had for mechanical
inventions; but, about four years after he had given up
shaving beards, he is found enthusiastically bent on the
project of discovering the “perpetual motion,” and, in
his quest for a person to make him some wheels, gets
acquainted with a clockmaker of Warrington, named
Kay. This individual had also been for some time bent
on the construction of new mechanic powers, and, either
to him alone, or to the joint wit of the two, is to be
attributed their entry on an attempt at Preston, in Lancashire,
to erect a novel machine for spinning cotton-thread.
The partnership was broken, and the endeavour
given up, in consequence of the threats uttered by the
working spinners, who dreaded that such an invention
would rob them of bread, by lessening the necessity for
human labour; and Arkwright alone, bent on the
accomplishment of the design, went to Nottingham. A
firm of bankers in that town made him some advances
of capital, with a view to partake in the benefits arising
from his invention; but, as Arkwright’s first machines
did not answer his end efficiently, they grew weary of
the connection, and refused further supplies. Unshaken
in his own belief of future success, Arkwright now took
his models to a firm of stocking weavers, one of whom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Mr. Strutt—a name which has also become eminent in
the manufacturing enterprise of the country—was a
man of intelligence, and of some degree of acquaintance
with science. This firm entered into a partnership with
Arkwright, and, he having taken out a patent for his
invention, they built a spinning-mill, to be driven by
horse-power, and filled it with frames. Two years afterwards
they built another mill at Cromford, in Derbyshire,
moved by water-power; but it was in the face of losses
and discouragements that they thus pushed their speculations.
During five years they sunk twelve thousand
pounds, and his partners were often on the point of giving
up the scheme. But Arkwright’s confidence only increased
by failure, and, by repeated essays at contrivance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
he finally and most triumphantly succeeded. He
lived to realise an immense fortune, and his present
descendant is understood to be one of the wealthiest
persons in the kingdom. The weight of cotton imported
now is three hundred times greater than it was a century
ago; and its manufacture, since the invention of Arkwright,
has become the greatest in England.</p>

<h3>THE REV. EDMUND CARTWRIGHT, D.D.,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">Must be mentioned as the meritorious individual who
completed the discovery of cotton manufacture, by the
invention of the power-loom. His tendency towards
mechanical contrivances had often displayed itself in his
youth; but his love of literature, and settlement in the
church, led him to lay aside such pursuits as trifles, and
it was not till his fortieth year that a conversation
occurred which roused his dormant faculty. His own
account of it must be given, not only for the sake of its
striking character, but for the powerful negative it puts
upon the hackneyed observation, that almost all great
and useful discoveries have resulted from “accident.”
The narrative first appeared in the “Supplement to the
Encyclopædia Britannica.”</p>

<p>“Happening to be at Matlock, in the summer of 1784,
I fell in company with some gentlemen of Manchester,
when the conversation turned on Arkwright’s spinning-machinery.
One of the company observed that, as soon
as Arkwright’s patent expired, so many mills would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
erected, and so much cotton spun, that hands would
never be found to weave it. To this observation I replied,
that Arkwright must then set his wits to work to
invent a weaving-mill. This brought on a conversation
upon the subject, in which the Manchester gentlemen
unanimously agreed that the thing was impracticable,
and, in defence of their opinion, they adduced arguments
which I was certainly incompetent to answer, or even to
comprehend, being totally ignorant of the subject, having
never at the time seen a person weave. I controverted,
however, the impracticability of the thing by
remarking that there had been lately exhibited in London
an automaton figure which played at chess. ‘Now,
you will not assert, gentlemen,’ said I, ‘that it is more
difficult to construct a machine that shall weave, than
one that shall make all the variety of moves that are
required in that complicated game.’ Some time afterwards,
a particular circumstance recalling this conversation
to my mind, it struck me that, as in plain weaving,
according to the conception I then had of the business,
there could be only three movements, which were to
follow each other in succession, there could be little
difficulty in producing and repeating them. Full of
these ideas, I immediately employed a carpenter and
smith to carry them into effect. As soon as the machine
was finished I got a weaver to put in the warp, which
was of such materials as sail-cloth is usually made of.
To my great delight, a piece of cloth, such as it was,
was the produce. As I had never before turned my
thoughts to mechanism, either in theory or practice, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
had seen a loom at work, nor knew anything of its construction,
you will readily suppose that my first loom
must have been a most rude piece of machinery. The
warp was laid perpendicularly; the reed fell with a force
of at least half-a-hundred weight; and the springs which
threw the shuttle were strong enough to have thrown a
congreve rocket. In short, it required the strength of
two powerful men to work the machine, at a slow rate,
and only for a short time. Conceiving, in my simplicity,
that I had accomplished all that was required, I then
secured what I thought a most valuable property by a
patent, 4th of April, 1785. This being done, I then
condescended to see how other people wove; and you
will guess my astonishment when I compared their easy
modes of operation with mine. Availing myself, however,
of what I then saw, I made a loom in its general
principles nearly as they are now made. But it was
not till the year 1787 that I completed my invention,
when I took out my last weaving patent, August the
1st of that year.”</p>

<p>Challenged by a manufacturer who came to see his
machine, to render it capable of weaving checks or fancy
patterns, Dr. Cartwright applied his mind to the discovery,
and succeeded so perfectly, that when the
manufacturer visited him again some weeks after, the
visitor declared he was assisted by something beyond
human power. Were these discoveries the fruit of
“accident,” or were they attributable to the power
of mind, unswervingly bent to attain its object by
Perseverance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Numerous additional inventions in manufactures and
agriculture owe their origin to this good, as well as
ingenious man, whose mind was so utterly uncorrupted
by any sordid passion that he neglected to turn his
discoveries to any great pecuniary benefit, even when
secured to him by patent. The merchants and manufacturers
of Manchester, however, memorialised the
Lords of the Treasury in his behalf, during his latter
years, and Parliament made him a grant of 10,000<em>l.</em>
Dr. Cartwright directed his mind to the steam-engine,
among his other thoughts, and told his son, many years
before the prophecy was realised, that, if he lived to
manhood, he would see both ships and land-carriages
moved by steam. From seeing one of his models of a
steam-vessel, it is asserted Fulton, then a painter in
this country, urged the idea of steam navigation upon
his countrymen, on his return to America, until he saw
it triumphantly carried out.</p>

<p>The new and vast motive power just mentioned conducts
us to another illustrious name in the list of the
disciples of Perseverance. Like the names of Newton,
Gutenberg the inventor of printing, and a few others,
the name to which we allude has claims upon the gratitude
of mankind which can never be fully rendered
until the entire race participate in the superior civilization
it is the certain destiny of these grand discoveries
to institute.</p>

<h3>JAMES WATT,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">Was the son of a small merchant of Greenock, and, on
account of his weakly state when a child, was unable
at first to enjoy the advantages of school tuition, and
was therefore taught chiefly at home. When but six
years old he was frequently caught chalking diagrams
and solving problems on the hearth; and at fourteen he
made a rude electrical machine with his own hands.
His aunt, it is related, often chided him for indolence
and mischief when he was found playing with the tea-kettle
on the fire, watching the steam coming out of the
spout, and trying the steam’s force by obstructing its
escape; the might of the vaporous element seeming
even then to have begun to present itself, unavoidably,
to his imagination and understanding. He grew to be
an extensive manufacturer of philosophical toys while a
boy, and used to increase his pocket-money by standing
with them at the college gate, in Glasgow, and vending
them to the students as they passed out. At eighteen
years of age his father apprenticed him to a mathematical
instrument maker in London, but in little more
than a year his weak health rendered it necessary to
send him home to Scotland.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b_092fp" style="max-width: 49.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_092fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">James Watt—when a Boy—playing
With the Tea-kettle.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At twenty-one, although he had received so little
instruction in that profession, his skill secured him the
appointment of mathematical instrument maker to the
college of Glasgow. His appointment, however, was
not sufficiently productive to render it worth keeping;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
and, seven years afterwards, he began to practise as
a general engineer, for which diligent study during
this term had fitted him. He was soon sought after
for almost every undertaking of public improvement;
whether for the making of bridges, canals, harbours, or
any other engineering design projected in Scotland.
But the circumstance of a small model of a steam-engine
being sent him to repair, fixed his attention
powerfully upon the element which had so often excited
the attention of his boyish understanding.</p>

<p>Watt found this model so imperfect, although it was
the most perfect then known, that he could with difficulty
get it to work. The more he examined it, the
more deeply he became convinced that the properties of
steam had never been understood; the engine was, in
fact, an atmospheric rather than a steam engine. By
laborious investigation he ascertained that the evaporation
of water proceeded more or less rapidly in proportion
to the degree of heat made to enter it; that the process
of evaporation was quickened as a greater surface of
water was exposed to heat, the quantity of coals necessary
to raise a certain weight of water into steam, and
the degrees of heat at which water boils under different
pressures. He had now learnt enough of the nature of
the great element he proposed to wield; but it required
long thought and the most exhaustless application of
contrivance to give his vaporous giant a fitting body,
limbs, joints, and sinews, and so to adapt these as to
render them a self-regulating mechanism. Watt found
a coadjutor in the person of Boulton, of Birmingham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
who was possessed of capital, and the will to embark it;
and he now set to work to perfect his discovery, and did
perfect it; thus revealing to man the greatest instrument
of power yet put into his possession.</p>

<p>“In the present perfect state of the engine,” says
Dr. Arnott, in his “Elements of Physics,” “it appears a
thing almost endowed with intelligence. It regulates
with perfect accuracy and uniformity the number of its
strokes in a given time; counting or recording them,
moreover, to tell how much work it has done, as a clock
records the beats of its pendulum; it regulates the
quantity of steam admitted to work; the briskness of
the fire; the supply of water to the boiler; the supply
of coals to the fire; it opens and shuts its valves with
absolute precision as to time and manner; it oils its
joints; it takes out any air which may accidentally enter
into parts which should be vacuous; and when anything
goes wrong, which it cannot itself rectify, it warns its
attendants by ringing a bell: yet with all these talents
and qualities, and even when exerting the power of six
hundred horses, it is obedient to the hand of a child;
its aliment is coal, wood, charcoal, or other combustible;
it consumes none while idle; it never tires, and wants
no sleep; it is not subject to malady when originally
well made, and only refuses to work when worn out with
age; it is equally active in all climates, and will do work
of any kind; it is a water pumper, a miner, a sailor, a
cotton-spinner, a weaver, a blacksmith, a miller, &amp;c., &amp;c.;
and a small engine, in the character of a steam-pony,
may be seen dragging after it on a railroad a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
tons of merchandise, or a regiment of soldiers, with
greater speed than that of our fleetest coaches. It is
the king of machines, and a permanent realisation of the
genii of Eastern fable, whose supernatural powers were
occasionally at the command of man.”</p>

<p>And what was the greater instrument? The mind of
Watt, whose powers were manifested by the creation of
this grandest physical instrument. Could such a display
of resources, such amazing circumspection of the wants
and needs of his machine, and wisdom in the adaptation
of its members to the perfect working of the whole,
have been given forth from an intellect untrained itself
to rule, uninured itself to toil, and to toil with certitude
for an end, by persevering collection of all that could
increase its aptitude to reach it? The estimate of
James Watt’s character by the eloquent Lord Jeffrey,
will afford a weighty answer.</p>

<p>“Independently of his great attainments in mechanics,
Mr. Watt was an extraordinary, and, in many respects,
a wonderful man. Perhaps no individual in his age
possessed so much and such varied and exact information—had
read so much, or remembered what he had
read so accurately and well. He had infinite quickness
of apprehension, a prodigious memory, and a certain
rectifying and methodising power of understanding,
which extracted something precious out of all that was
presented to it. His stores of miscellaneous knowledge
were immense, and yet less astonishing than the command
he had at all times over them. It seemed as if
every subject that was casually started in conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
had been that which he had been last occupied in studying
and exhausting; such was the copiousness, the
precision, the admirable clearness of the information
which he poured out upon it without effort or hesitation.
Nor was this promptitude and compass of knowledge
confined in any degree to the studies connected with his
ordinary pursuits. That he should have been minutely
and extensively skilled in chemistry and the arts, and
in most of the branches of physical science might,
perhaps, have been conjectured; but it could not have
been inferred from his usual occupations, and, probably,
is not generally known, that he was curiously learned in
many branches of antiquity, metaphysics, medicine, and
etymology, and perfectly at home in all the details of
architecture, music, and law. He was well acquainted,
too, with most of the modern languages, and familiar
with their most recent literature. Nor was it at all extraordinary
to hear the great mechanician and engineer
detailing and expounding, for hours together, the metaphysical
theories of the German logicians, or criticising
the measures or the matter of the German poetry.</p>

<p>“His astonishing memory was aided, no doubt, in a
great measure, by a still higher and rarer faculty—by
his power of digesting and arranging in its proper place
all the information he received, and of casting aside and
rejecting, as it were instinctively, whatever was worthless
or immaterial. Every conception that was suggested to
his mind seemed instantly to take its place among its
other rich furniture, and to be condensed into the
smallest and most convenient form. He never appeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
therefore, to be at all encumbered or perplexed with the
<em>verbiage</em> of the dull books he perused, or the idle talk to
which he listened, but to have at once extracted, by a
kind of intellectual alchemy, all that was worthy of
attention, and to have reduced it for his own use to its
true value and to its simplest form. And thus it often
happened that a great deal more was learned, from his
brief and vigorous account of the theories and arguments
of tedious writers, than an ordinary student could have
derived from the most faithful study of the originals;
and that errors and absurdities became manifest from
the mere clearness and plainness of his statement of
them, which might have deluded and perplexed most of
his hearers without that invaluable assistance.”</p>

<p>Such was the activity, industry, discipline, and perseverance
in acquirement, of the mind which gave to the
world its greatest physical transformer—the instrument
which is changing the entire civilization of the world,
“doing the work of multitudes, overcoming the difficulties
of depth, distance, minuteness, magnitude, wind,
and tide; exhibiting stranger wonders than those of
romance or magic; annihilating time and space; giving
wings even to thought, and sending knowledge like light
through the human universe; most mighty, with power
that Watt knew not of, and with more than we know,
for futurity. The discovery of America,” says the same
eloquent writer, W. J. Fox, in his “Lectures to the
Working Classes,” “was of matter to be worked upon:
this is power to work upon the world.”</p>

<h3>SIR ISAAC NEWTON,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">It is so well known, as scarcely to need repeating here,
displayed his wondrous and incontrollable tendency for
scientific inquiry in boyhood. In him, too, as in the
minds of almost all philosophical discoverers, was
evinced the faculty for mechanical contrivance, as well
as acuteness for demonstration. The anecdotes of his
boyish invention, of his windmill with a mouse for the
miller, his water-clock, carriage, and sun-dials, and of
his kites and paper lanterns, are familiar. His mother
having been persuaded, by an intelligent relative, to
give him up from agricultural cares, to which his genius
could not be tied down, he was sent to Cambridge, and
entered Trinity College in his eighteenth year. He
proceeded, at once, to the study of “Descartes’ Geometry,”
regarding “Euclid’s Elements” as containing
self-evident truths, when he had gone through the titles
of the propositions. Yet he afterwards regretted this
neglect of the rigid method of demonstration, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
outset, as a great mistake, and wished he had not
attached himself so closely to modes of solution by
algebra. He successively studied, and wrote commentaries
on, “Wallis’s Arithmetic of Infinities,” “Saunderson’s
Logic,” and “Kepler’s Optics;” and, for testing
the doctrines of the latter science, bought a prism, and
made numerous experiments with it. While but a very
young man, Dr. Isaac Barrow, the Lucasian Professor
of Mathematics, gathered hints of new truths from his
conversation; and in the publication of his lectures on
optics, a few years after, the Doctor acknowledged his
obligations to young Newton, and characterised him very
highly. A year after this publication, Barrow resigned
his chair in favour of Newton, who had recently taken
the degree of Master of Arts.</p>

<p>Zeal to acquit himself well in his professorship, a
situation so congenial to his mind, led him to devote the
most profound attention to the doctrines of light and
vision. Realities were what he sought, even in the most
abstract pursuits; and he expended considerable manual
labour in constructing reflecting telescopes. One of
these most valued relics of his mechanical toil is now
in the library of the Royal Society. The result of his
studies and experiments was not fully known before the
publication of his “Opticks,” in his sixty-second year;
but it is believed his entire discovery of the nature of
light was made many years before, being at length “put
together out of scattered papers.” The modesty of
this great man was, indeed, the most distinguishing
mark of his intellect. Arrogant satisfaction, or pride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
of superior genius, never sullied his greatness. Even in
giving this scientific treasure to the world, he says, he
designed to repeat most of his observations with more
care and exactness, and to make some new ones for determining
the manner how the rays of light are bent in
their passage by bodies, for making the fringes of colours
with the dark lines between them.</p>

<p>How much are we indebted to the patient perseverance
of all the true discoverers in science! This is the
quality of mind which ever distinguished them. Rashness
and presumption, haste to place his crude theories
before the world, and to gain assent to them before
proof, on the other hand, are the sure marks of the empiric
or pretender. The popular author of “The Pursuit
of Knowledge under Difficulties”—a work the
young student should carry about with him as a never-failing
stimulus to perseverance—thus admirably treats
this pre-eminent characteristic of the mind of Newton:—“On
some occasions he was wont to say, that, if there
was any mental habit or endowment in which he excelled
the generality of men, it was that of patience in the
examination of the facts and phenomena of his subject.
This was merely another form of that teachableness
which constituted the character of the man. He loved
truth, and wooed her with the unwearying ardour of a
lover. Other speculators had consulted the book of
nature, principally for the purpose of seeking in it the
defence of some favourite theory: partially, therefore,
and hastily, as one would consult a dictionary. Newton
perused it as a volume altogether worthy of being studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
for its own sake. Hence proceeded both the patience
with which he traced its characters, and the rich and
plentiful discoveries with which the search rewarded
him. If he afterwards classified and systematised his
knowledge like a philosopher, he had first, to use his
own language, gathered it like a child.”</p>

<p>This transcendent combination of qualities, modesty,
patient investigation, and indefatigable perseverance, was
still more wondrously shown in his superlative discovery
of the theory of gravitation, than in his promulgation
of the laws of light and vision. The anecdote of his
observation of the fall of an apple from a tree, while
sitting in his garden, is among the most familiar of all
anecdotes to general readers. This incident, it was
affirmed by his niece, as well as his friend Dr. Pemberton,
occurred in Newton’s twenty-third year; and it
instantly raised in him the inquiry whether the infinite
universe were not held in order and kept in motion by
the very power which drew the apple to the earth.</p>

<p>Galileo had already shown the tendency of all bodies
near the earth to gravitate towards its centre, and had
calculated and fixed the proportions of their speed in
descent to their distance from the earth’s centre. Newton’s
general application of Galileo’s rule to the planets
of the solar system led him to regard his conjecture as
strongly probable. He next devoted his powers to the
consideration of its verity, by examining the question
whether the force of gravitation by which the planets
preserved their orbits and motions round the sun would
precisely account for the moon’s preservation of her orbit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and motion round the earth. But here the precision of
his calculations was frustrated by the imperfect knowledge
then existing as to the real measurement of the
earth—the gravitating centre of the revolving moon.
An empiric would have trumpeted his discovery to the
world, in spite of the fact that this faulty admeasurement
of the earth, by not affording a true calculation of her
gravitating power, failed to lead him to an agreement
with truth. Newton was silent for long years, until a
degree of the earth’s latitude was ascertained, by actual
experiment, to be sixty-nine and a half degrees instead
of sixty; he then resumed his calculations, and their
result was that he had probed the grand secret of the
laws by which worlds move in obedience to the suns
which are their centres. It only remains to be observed,
as a significant reminder to the young reader, that—though
he may <em>assent</em> to the great doctrine of Newton,
and consider it to be established, he can never fully
<em>know</em> its mathematical and mechanical verity, unless
study enables him to read the “Principia”—the work
in which the truth of gravitation and its laws are demonstrated.
Let it be an additional motive to strive for
the ability to read such a book, that in having read it
the student has become acquainted with the greatest
effort in abstract truth ever yet produced by the human
intellect.</p>

<p>The moral as well as the intellectual grandeur of the
life of Newton would tempt us to enlarge, but we must
merely say, ere we pass on, to the youthful inquirer—read
about Newton, think about Newton, and the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
you know of him the more will your understanding
honour him, your heart love him, and your desire
strengthen to approach him in virtue, wisdom, and usefulness.</p>

<h3>SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp35" id="i_b_104" style="max-width: 51.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_104.jpg" alt="Sir William Herschel">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">Newton’s greatest successor in astronomical discovery,
may claim an equality with him, as a true and noble
disciple of perseverance. The son of a poor Hanoverian
musician, he was brought over to England, with his
father, in the band of the Guards. The father returned
to Hanover, but young Herschel remained, and at the
age of twenty began to seek his fortune in this country.
After many difficulties, wanderings from place to place,
as a teacher of music in families, and a few slight
glimpses of favour from fortune, he obtained the office
of organist in the Octagon Chapel at Bath. The emoluments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
of this situation, with his receipts from tuition
of pupils and other engagements, were such that an
ordinary mortal would have been content “to make
himself comfortable” upon them, in worldly phrase.
But ease and competence were not the object of Herschel’s
ambition. In the midst of his wanderings, he
had not only striven to acquire a sound knowledge of
English, but of Italian, Latin, and Greek, and had entered
on the study of counterpoint, in order to make
himself a profound theorist, as well as a performer, in
music. In order to comprehend the doctrines of harmonics,
he found it necessary to get some acquaintance
with the mathematics; and this led him at once to the line
of study for which his natural genius was best fitted.
On his settlement at Bath, he applied himself with
ardour to these abstract inquiries, and from the mathematics
proceeded to astronomy and optics. Desire to
view the wonders of the heavens for himself made him
eager to possess a telescope; and, deeming the price of
a sufficiently powerful one more than he could afford, he
set about making a five-feet reflector, and, after much
difficulty, accomplished his task.</p>

<p>Success only stimulated him to bolder attempts, and
he rapidly constructed telescopes of seven, ten, and
twenty-feet focal distance. Pupils and professional engagements
were given up, until he reduced his income
to a bare sufficiency, in order that he might have more
time for the sciences to which he was now become inseparably
attached. So tireless was his perseverance in
the fashioning of mirrors for his telescopes, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
would sit to polish them for twelve or fourteen hours,
without intermission; and, rather than take his hand
from the delicate labour, his sister was requested to put
the little food he ate into his mouth. With one of his
seven-feet reflectors—the most perfect instrument he
had constructed—after having been engaged for a year
and a half, at intervals, in a regular survey of the heavens,
he at length made the discovery of the planet
which, until the very recent discovery of “Neptune” by
Leverrier and Adams, was regarded as the most distant
member of the solar system. The Astronomer-Royal,
Dr. Maskelyne, to whom Herschel made known what
he had observed, together with his doubts as to the
nature of the new celestial body, first affirmed it to be
a comet. In a few months this error was dissipated,
and the grandeur of Herschel’s discovery was acknowledged
by the whole scientific world. King George the
Third, in whose honour he had named the new planet
Georgium Sidus (a name which has been very properly
set aside for that of Uranus), conferred upon him a
pension of £300 a year, that he might be enabled to give
up entirely the profession of music; and the son of the
poor Hanoverian musician took his station among
the first in the highest of the sciences. The order of
knighthood was afterwards bestowed upon him; but it
could not add to the splendour of the names of either
Herschel or Newton.</p>

<p>Inquiry will put the young reader in possession of a
knowledge of many other interesting and important discoveries
of the <em>persevering</em> Herschel. A few pages must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
be devoted to a brief mention of others who have benefited
mankind by their unremitting labours; and
they must be selected from a list where it is difficult to
tell a single name unmarked by some peculiar excellence—so
abundant in exemplars of meritorious toil is the
vast muster-roll of science and mechanical invention.</p>

<h3>REAUMUR,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">May be instanced as one of the most industrious toilers
for the advancement of useful science, though he does
not take rank with the unfolders of sublime truths.
During a life of seventy-five years he was incessantly
engaged in endeavouring to add something to the compass
of human knowledge and convenience. At one
time he is found pursuing an investigation into the
mode of formation and growth of shells, endeavouring to
account for the progressive motion of the different kinds
of testaceous animals; anon, he publishes a “Natural
History of Cobwebs,” evincing a mind capable of the
most minute and ingenious search; and is afterwards
found showing the facility with which iron and steel
may be made magnetic by percussion. For revealing
to his countrymen, the French, a method of converting
forged or bar-iron into steel, of making steel of what
quality they pleased, and of rendering even cast-iron
ductile, a pension of twelve hundred livres yearly was
settled upon him. This allowance, at his death, was
settled, by his own request, on the Academy of Sciences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
to be applied to the defraying of expenses for future
attempts to improve the arts. He also made known the
useful secret of tinning plates of iron, an article for
which the French, till his time, had been compelled to
resort to Germany.</p>

<p>Continuing his researches into natural science, he
showed the means by which marine animals attach
themselves to solid bodies; discussed the cause of the
electric effect from the stroke of a torpedo; displayed
the proof that in crabs, lobsters, and crayfish, nature reproduces
a lost claw; set forth a treatise showing, by experiments,
that the digestive process is performed in granivorous
birds by trituration, and in carnivorous by solution;
and published a systematic “History of Insects.”
Engaged at one period of life in proving, by experiment,
that the less a cord is twisted the stronger it is—that is,
that the best mode of uniting the threads of a cord
is that which causes their tension to be equal in whatever
direction the cord is strained; we find him, at another
period, discovering the art of preserving eggs, so that
they might be kept fresh and fit for incubation many
years, and breeds of fowls propagated at home or abroad,
by the eggs being washed with a varnish of oil, grease,
or any other substance that would effectually stop the
pores of the shell, and prevent the contents from evaporating.
Valuable secrets in the making of glass were
also discovered by him; he devised a method of making
porcelain, and showed that the requisite materials were
to be found in France in greater abundance than in the
East; and lastly, he rendered enduring service to science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
by reducing thermometers to a common standard, which
continental nations gratefully commemorate by still
calling thermometers by his name. A life passed in
mental occupations so multifarious as well as useful,
surely entitles Reaumur to be termed a true scholar of
perseverance.</p>
<br>

<hr class="r33">

<h3>THE HONOURABLE ROBERT BOYLE,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">By a life of virtue and usefulness, merits the epithet to
which his birth by courtesy entitled him. He was the
youngest son of the first Earl of Cork, and after being
educated at Eton was sent out to travel on the continent.
A residence at Florence at the time of Galileo’s death,
and the almost universal conversation then caused by
the discoveries of that great philosopher, seem to have
induced Boyle’s first attention to science. On returning
to this country he very soon joined a knot of scientific
men, who had begun to meet at each other’s houses, on
a certain day in each week, for inquiry and discussion
into what was then called “The New or Experimental
Philosophy.” These weekly meetings eventually gave
rise to the Royal Society of London; but part of the
original members of the little club, a few years after its
commencement, removed to Oxford, and Boyle, influenced
by his attachment to these philosophic friends, in
process of time took up his residence in that city. Their
weekly meetings were held in his house; and here he
began to prosecute with earnestness his researches into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the nature of air. By his experiments and invention,
the air-pump was first brought into so useful a form that
he may be called its discoverer, though the genius of
others has since greatly improved that important instrument.
He also demonstrated the necessity of the presence
of air for the support of animal life and of combustion;
showing not only that a flame is instantly
extinguished beneath an exhausted receiver, but that
even a fish could not live under it, though immersed in
water. His demonstration of the expansibility of air
was still more important. Aristotle, three hundred years
before the Christian era, taught that if air were rarefied
till it filled ten times its usual space, it would become
fire. Boyle succeeded in dilating a portion of the air of
the common atmosphere, till it filled nearly fourteen
thousand times its natural space.</p>

<p>His other discoveries were numerous, every hour of
his existence might be said to be devoted to usefulness:
and his wealth and station, so far from disposing him to
ease and inertion, were nobly turned by him into grand
aids for the advancement of knowledge. Mr. Craik thus
admirably sums up his life of effort:—“From his boyhood
till his death he may be said to have been almost constantly
occupied in making philosophical experiments; collecting
and ascertaining facts in natural science; inventing or
improving instruments for the examination of nature;
maintaining a regular correspondence with scientific
men in all parts of Europe; receiving the daily visits of
great numbers of the learned, both of his own and other
countries; perusing and studying not only all the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
works that appeared in the large and rapidly widening
department of natural history and mathematical and
experimental physics, including medicine, anatomy,
chemistry, geography, &amp;c., but many others, relating
especially to theology and oriental literature; and, lastly,
writing so profusely upon all these subjects, that those
of his works alone which have been preserved and collected,
independently of many others that are lost, fill, in
one edition, six large quarto volumes. So vast an
amount of literary performance, from a man who was
at the same time so much of a public character, and
gave so considerable a portion of his time to the service
of others, shows strikingly what may be done by industry,
<em>perseverance</em>, and such a method of life as never
suffers an hour of the day to run to waste.”</p>

<p>The lives of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Galileo, and
Kepler, among astronomers; of Napier of Murchiston,
the inventor of logarithms; of Dolland and Ramsden,
the improvers of optical glasses; of Cavendish, the discoverer
of the composition of water; of Linnæus and
Cuvier, the greatest naturalists; of Lavoisier, Fourcroy,
Black, and, indeed, a host of modern chemists; might
be singly and in order adduced as inspiring lessons of
perseverance. The young inquirer, if he have caught a
spark of zeal from the ardour of the tireless minds we
have hastily endeavoured to portray, will, if he act
worthily, strive to make himself acquainted more fully
with the doings of these and other great men, and “gird
up the loins of his mind” to follow them in their glorious
path of wisdom and beneficence.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Examples of a successful pursuit of wealth, either from
the beginnings of a moderate fortune, or from absolute
penury, are abundant. A life devoted to the acquirement
of money, for its own sake, cannot be made the
subject of moral eulogy; it can only be introduced
among the “Triumphs of Perseverance,” as a proof of
the efficacy of that quality of the mind to enable the
wealth-winner to compass his resolves. It by no means
follows, however, that a career towards opulence is impelled
by the mere sordid passion for gain. Happily,
among those who have started with a moderate fortune,
progressive increase in riches has often been found
united with increasing purposes of the noblest philanthropy
and public beneficence; while the manly aim for
independence has equally distinguished many who have
risen to wealth from poverty. A brief rehearsal of the
biographies of two persons, of widely different station
and character, but whose names have alike become
inseparably connected with the history of the first commercial
city in the world, will suffice to illustrate our
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<hr class="r33">

<h3>SIR THOMAS GRESHAM,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">The younger son of Sir Richard, who was a knight,
alderman, sheriff, and Lord Mayor of London, and a
prosperous merchant, had the twofold example set him
by his father, of an intelligent pursuit of trade, and of
public spirit and munificence. He was sent to Cambridge,
distinguished himself in study, and might, undoubtedly,
have risen to reputation in one of the learned
professions; but, by his father’s wish, he turned his
attention to business, and was admitted a member of the
Mercers’ Company at the age of twenty-four. Having,
through his father’s eminence as a merchant, succeeded
in obtaining the trust of agent to King Edward the
Sixth, for taking up money of the merchants of Antwerp,
he quickly discerned the abuses under which the
king’s interest suffered. He proposed methods for preventing
the Flemish merchants from extorting unfair
commissions and brokages, and so turned the current of
advantage to the king’s favour, that the young prince
was enabled to pay all the debts for which his father and
the Protector—Somerset—had left him responsible.
During the short reign of Edward, this active and enterprising
merchant made forty journeys from England to
Antwerp; and, by the application of his genius, retrieved
English commerce from the disadvantage into which it
had fallen by mismanagement at home, and the superior
shrewdness of the Netherland merchants. The precious
metals had become scarce in our country, but Gresham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
brought them back again; our commodities were low in
price, and foreign ones high, but he reversed their conditions
of sale: while the king’s credit, from being very
low abroad, was, by Gresham’s skill, raised so high, that
he could have borrowed what sums he pleased. For
such services the young and acute negotiator had a pension
of £100 a year appointed him for life, and estates
to the value of £300 a year were also conferred upon
him by the king.</p>

<p>At the accession of Mary, Gresham was discharged
from his agency; but, on his drawing up a memorial,
and its allegements being proved, he was re-instated.
Queen Elizabeth immediately re-engaged him, at her
accession, and employed him to provide and buy up
arms for the national defence. She knighted him a year
afterwards, and he then built himself the mansion known
by his name in Bishopsgate Street; and, till lately,
occupied by the “Gresham professors.”</p>

<p>His noblest public work was performed soon after.
His father had striven to move King Henry the Eighth
to build an Exchange for the city merchants, who then
met in the open air in Lombard Street, but could not.
Sir Thomas Gresham now publicly proposed, if the
citizens would purchase a piece of ground large enough,
and in the proper place, to build an Exchange at his
own expense, with covered walks, and all necessary conveniences
for the assemblage of merchants. This was
done; the site was cleared; Gresham himself laid the
foundation stone; and Queen Elizabeth, when the building
was complete, “attended by nobility, came from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Somerset House, and caused it, by trumpet and herald,
to be proclaimed the ‘Royal Exchange.’” This building,
as our young readers know, was burnt down some
years ago, and the present stately fabric, opened by
Queen Victoria, has been erected on its site.</p>

<p>About the time that the building of the Royal Exchange
was commenced, Gresham was again employed
to take up moneys for the royal use at Antwerp. Experience
had so fully shown him the evil of pursuing
this system, that he at length persuaded the Queen to
discontinue it, and to borrow of her own merchants in
the city of London. Yet his views were so much in
advance of the contracted commercial spirit of that
age, that the London citizens, in their common hall,
blind to their own interests, negatived his proposition
when it was first made to them. But, on more
mature consideration, several merchants and aldermen
raised £16,000, and lent it to the Queen for six months,
at six per cent. interest; and the loan was prolonged
for six months more, at the same interest, with brokage.
This illustrious London citizen, by his superior intelligence,
thus opened the way for increasing others’ as
well as his own gains.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Gresham’s successful negotiations issued
in so large an increase of his own wealth, that he purchased
large estates in several counties, and bought
Osterley Park, near Brentford, where he built a large
mansion, in which he was accustomed to receive the
visits of Elizabeth. Even here the ideas of the merchant
were predominant. “The house,” says a writer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
period, “standeth in a parke, well wooded and garnished
with many faire ponds, which affoorded not onely fish
and fowle, as swannes and other water fowle, but also
great use for milles, as paper milles, oyle milles, and
corn milles.” On his retirement to Osterley, he transformed
his residence in Bishopsgate Street into a “college,”
for the abode of seven bachelor professors, who
were to read lectures there on “divinity, law, physic,
astronomy, geometry, music, and rhetoric,” and to have
£50 each per year.</p>

<p>He was the richest commoner in England—such were
what is usually termed “the substantial” rewards of
his perseverance; while his name deserves lasting
honour as the patron of learning, and the exemplar of
merchant-beneficence. He left, by will, not only ample
funds for continuing his “professorships,” but endowments
for almshouses, and yearly sums for ten of the
city prisons and hospitals.</p>

<h3>JAMES LACKINGTON,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp35" id="i_b_117" style="max-width: 48.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_117.jpg" alt="James Lackington">
</figure>

<p class="no-indent">The son of a journeyman shoemaker and of a weaver’s
daughter, passed his early years amidst circumstances
which must have enduringly impressed him with the
miseries of vice and poverty. His father was a selfish
and habitual drunkard, and his mother frequently worked
nineteen or twenty hours out of the four-and-twenty to
support her family. He was the eldest child of a numerous
family, and was put two or three years to a dame’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
school; but was less intent on learning than on “getting
on in the world,” even while a boy. He heard a pieman
cry his wares, and soon proposed to a baker to sell pies
for him; and so successful did young Lackington prove
as a pie-vender, that he heard the baker declare, a
twelvemonth after, that he had been the means of extricating
him from embarrassment. A boyish prank put
an end to this engagement; and when the baker wished
to renew it Lackington’s father insisted on placing him
at the stall. Again, however, his pedlar inclinations,
which in after life led him to affluence, rescued him
from the disagreeable treatment he expected to receive
under his father’s rule. He heard a man cry almanacks
in the street, and importuned his father till he obtained
leave to start on the same itinerant enterprise. In this
he succeeded so well that he deeply aggrieved the other
venders, who, as he tells us in his very whimsical but
interesting biography, would have “done him a mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
had he not possessed a light pair of heels.” Resolute
on not continuing at home, he persuaded his father, at
length, to bind him apprentice with a shoemaker in a
neighbouring town, and at fourteen years of age sat
down to learn his trade.</p>

<p>We will not follow this singular specimen of human
nature, spoilt by want of education and by evil example,
through all the vagaries of his youth. Taking him up
at four-and-twenty, after he had experienced considerable
changes in religious feeling, and gathered some
smatterings of knowledge from reading, we find him
marrying, and beginning the world the next morning
with one halfpenny. Yet he and his wife set cheerfully
to work, he tells us; and by great industry and self-denial,
they not only earned a living, but paid off a debt
of forty shillings, which was somewhat summarily
claimed by a friend of whom he had borrowed that
sum. Trials very soon fell to his lot which tended to
make him deeply thoughtful. His wife was ill for six
months; and, at the end of that period, he was compelled
to remove her from Bristol to Taunton, for her
health’s sake. During two years and a half the poor
woman was removed five times to and from Taunton
without permanent recovery; and Lackington, despairing
of an amendment of his circumstances under such
discouragements, resolved to leave his native district.
He therefore gave his wife all the money he had, except
what he thought would suffice to bring him to London;
and, mounting a stage coach, reached town with but
half-a-crown in his pocket. He got work the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
morning, saved enough in a month to bring up his wife,
and she had tolerable health, and obtained “binding
work” from his employer.</p>

<p>Lackington was now fairly entered on the path to
prosperity. His partner was a pattern of self-denial and
economy; they began to save money, bought clothes,
and then household furniture, left lodgings, and had a
house of their own. A friend, not long after, proposed
that Lackington should take a little shop and parlour,
which were “to let” in Featherstone-street, City-road,
and commence master shoemaker. Lackington agreed,
but also formed the resolution to sell old books. With
his own scanty collection, a bagful of old volumes he
purchased for a guinea, and his scraps of leather,
altogether worth about 5<em>l.</em>, he accordingly commenced
master tradesman. He soon sold off, and increased his
stock of books; and next borrowed 5<em>l.</em> of John Wesley’s
people—“a sum of money kept on purpose to lend out
for three months, without interest, to such of their
society whose characters were good, and who wanted
temporary relief.” Much to his shame he traduces the
character of the philanthropic Wesley and of his brother
religionists, in his “Confessions,” even while acknowledging
that this benevolent loan was “of great service”
to him. He afterwards endeavoured to make the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amende
honorable</i>, but the mode in which it was made was as
unadmirable as his ungrateful offence. But, to return
to his narrative.</p>

<p>“In our new situation,” says he, “we lived in a very
frugal manner, often dining on potatoes, and quenching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
our thirst with water, being determined, if possible, to
make some provision for such dismal times as sickness
and shortness of work, which had often been our lot,
and might be again.” In six months he became worth
five-and-twenty pounds in old book stock, removed into
Chiswell-street, to a more commodious shop, though the
street, he says, was then (in 1775) a dull street, gave up
shoemaking, “turned his leather into books,” and soon
began to have a great sale. Another series of reverses,
during which his wife died, his shop was closed, while
he himself was prostrate with fever, and was robbed by
nurses, only served to sharpen his intents and strengthen
his perseverance, when he recovered. His second marriage,
with an intelligent woman, he found of immense
advantage, since his new partner was a very efficient
helpmate in the book-shop. Next, his friend Dennis
became partaker in his business, and advanced a small
capital, by which they “doubled stock,” and printed
their first catalogue of 12,000 volumes. They took 20<em>l.</em>
the first week, and Dennis then advanced 200<em>l.</em> more
towards the trade; but, after two years, Lackington was
left once more to himself, his friend being weary of the
business. A resolution not to give credit gave him
great difficulty, he says, for at least seven years, but he
carried his plan at last, principally by selling at very
small profits. His business premises were successively
enlarged, and his sales likewise, until his trade and himself
became wonders. At the age of fifty-two he went
out of business, leaving his cousin head of the firm. He
sold 100,000 volumes annually, during the latter years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
of his personal attention to trade, kept his carriage,
purchased two estates, and built himself a genteel house.
He once more became a professor of religion, on retiring
from business, and built several chapels. He was, in
the close of life, benevolent in visiting the sick and
indigent, and in relieving the distressed.</p>

<p>“As the first king of Bohemia kept his country shoes
by him to remind him from whence he was taken,” says
the bookseller, in his “Confessions,” “so I have put a
motto on the doors of my carriage, constantly to remind
me to what I am indebted for my prosperity, viz.
‘Small profits do great things;’ and reflecting on the
means by which I have been enabled to support a
carriage, adds not a little to the pleasure of riding in it.”
Alluding to the stories that were rife respecting his
success, attributing it to his purchasing a “fortunate
lottery-ticket,” or “finding bank-notes in an old book,”
he says, very emphatically, “I found the whole that I
am possessed of, in—<em>small profits</em>, bound by <em>industry</em>,
and clasped by <em>economy</em>.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">One conviction forms the basis of all correct admiration
for the heroism and intrepidity of scientific discoverers,
the marvellous inventions of mechanicians; the sublime
enthusiasm of poets, artists, and musicians; the laborious
devotion of scholars; and even of the intelligent industry
of the accumulators of wealth: it is that all their efforts
and achievements tend, by the law of our nature, to the
amelioration of man’s condition. In every mind swayed
by reflection, and not by impulse or prejudice, the
world’s admiration for warriors is regarded as mistaken,
because the deeds of the soldier are the infliction of
suffering and destruction, spring from the most evil
passions, and serve but to keep up the real hindrances
of civilization and human happiness. Statues and
columns erected in honour of conquerors, excellent as
they may be for the display of art, serve, therefore, in
every correct mind, for subjects of regretful rather than
encouraging and satisfactory contemplation. The self-sacrificing
enterprises of the philanthropist, on the contrary,
create in every properly regulated mind, still purer
admiration, still more profound and enduring esteem,
than even the noblest and grandest efforts of the children
of Mind and Imagination. The <span class="smcap">Divine Exemplar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></span>
himself is at the head of their class; and they seem, of
all the sons of men, most transcendently to reflect his
image, because their deeds are direct acts of mercy and
goodness, and misery and suffering flee at their approach.
Harbingers of the benign reign of Human Brotherhood
which the popular spirit of our age devoutly regards as
the eventual destiny of the world, they will be venerated,
and their memories cherished and loved, when laurelled
conquerers are mentioned no more with praise, or are
forgotten. Emulation is sometimes termed a motive of
questionable morality; but to emulate the high and holy
in enterprises of self-sacrificing beneficence can never be
an unworthy passion; for half the value of a good man’s
life would be lost, if his example did not serve to fill
others with such a plenitude of love for his goodness, as
to impel them to imitate him.</p>

<p>It is the example of the philanthropist, then, that we
commend, above all other examples, to the imitation of
all who are beginning life. We would say, scorn indolence,
ignorance, and reckless imprudence that makes
you dependent on others’ effort instead of your own;
but, more than all, scorn selfishness and a life useless to
man, your brother, cleave to knowledge, industry, and
refinement; but, beyond all, cleave to goodness.</p>

<p>In a world where so much is wrong—where, for ages,
the cupidity of some, and the ignorance and improvidence
of a greater number—has increased the power of
wrong, it need not be said how dauntless must be the
soul of perseverance needed to overcome this wrong by
the sole and only effectual efforts of gentleness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
goodness. That wisdom—deeply calculating wisdom—not
impulsive and indiscriminate “charity,” as it is
falsely named—should also lend its calm but energetic
guidance to him who aims to assist in removing the
miseries of the world, must be equally evident. To
understand to what morally resplendent deeds this
dauntless spirit can conduct, when thus guided by wisdom,
and armed with the sole power of gentleness, we
need to fix our observance but on one name—the most
worshipful soldier of humanity our honoured land has
ever produced: the true champion of <em>persevering</em> goodness.</p>

<h3>JOHN HOWARD,</h3>

<p class="no-indent">Inheriting a handsome competence from his father,
whom he lost while young, went abroad early, and in
Italy acquired a taste for art. He made purchases of
such specimens of the great masters as his means would
allow, and embellished therewith his paternal seat of
Cardington, in Bedfordshire. His first wife, who had
attended him with the utmost kindness during a severe
illness, and whom, though much older than himself, he
had married from a principle of gratitude, died within
three years of their union; and to relieve his mind from
the melancholy occasioned by her death, he resolved on
leaving England for another tour. The then recent
earthquake which had laid Lisbon in ruins, rendered
Portugal a clime of interest with him, and he set sail for
that country. The packet, however, was captured by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
French privateer; and he and other prisoners were carried
into Brest, and placed in the castle. They had
been kept forty hours without food or water before entering
the filthy dungeon into which they were cast,
and it was still a considerable time before a joint of
mutton was thrown into the midst of them, which, for
want of the accommodation even of a solitary knife,
they were obliged to tear to pieces and gnaw like dogs.
For nearly a week Howard and his companions were
compelled to lie on the floor of this dungeon, with nothing
but straw to shelter them from its noxious and
unwholesome damps. He was then removed to another
town where British prisoners were kept; and though
permitted to reside in the town on his “parole,” or word
of honour, he had evidence, he says, that many hundreds
of his countrymen perished in their imprisonment, and
that, at one place, thirty-six were buried in a hole in
one day. He was at length permitted to return home,
but it was upon his promise to go back to France, if his
own government should refuse to exchange him for a
French naval officer. As he was only a private individual,
it was doubtful whether government would consent
to this; and he desired his friends to forbear the congratulations
with which they welcomed his return, assuring
them he should perform his promise, if government
expressed a refusal. Happily the negotiation terminated
favourably, and Howard felt himself, once more,
at complete freedom in his native land.</p>

<p>It is to this event, comprising much personal suffering
for himself, and the grievous spectacle of so much distress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
endured by his sick and dying fellow-countrymen
in bonds, that the first great emotion in the mind of
this exalted philanthropist must be dated. Yet, like
many deep thoughts which have resulted in noble actions,
Howard’s grand life-thought lay a long time in the
germ within the recesses of his reflective faculty. He
first returned to his Cardington estate, and, together
with his delight in the treasures of art, occupied his
mind with meteorological observations, which he followed
up with such assiduity as to draw upon himself
some notice from men of science, and to be chosen a
Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>After his second marriage, he continued to reside upon
his estate, and to improve and beautify it. The grounds
were, indeed, laid out with a degree of taste only
equalled on the estates of the nobility. But it was impossible
for such a nature as Howard’s to be occupied
solely with a consideration of his pleasures and comforts.
His tenantry were the constant objects of his care, and
in the improvement of their habitations and modes of
life he found delightful employment for by far the
greater portion of his time. In his beneficent plans for
the amelioration of the condition of the poor he was
nobly assisted by the second Mrs. Howard, who was a
woman of exemplary and self-sacrificing benevolence.
One act alone affords delightful proof of this. She
sold her jewels soon after her marriage, and put the
money into a purse called, by herself and her husband,
“the charity-purse,” from the consecration of its contents
to the relief of the poor and destitute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>The death of this excellent woman plunged him again
into sorrow, from which he, at first, sought relief in
watching over the nurture of the infant son she had
left him, having breathed her last soon after giving birth
to the child. When his son was old enough to be
transferred entirely to the care of a tutor, Howard renewed
his visits to the continent. His journal contains
proof that his mind was deeply engaged in reflection on
all he saw; but neither yet does the master-thought of
his life appear to have strengthened to such a degree as
to make itself very evident in the workings of his heart
and understanding. His election to the office of high
sheriff of the county of Bedford, on his return, seems to
have been the leading occurrence in his life, judging by
the influence it threw on the tone of his thinkings and
the character of his acts, to the end of his mortal
career. He was forty-six years of age at the time of
his election to this office, intellectual culture had refined
his character, and much personal trial and affliction had
deepened his experience: the devotion of such a man as
John Howard to his great errand of philanthropy was
not, therefore, any vulgar and merely impulsive enthusiasm.
We have seen that the germ of his design had
lain for years in his mind, scarcely fructifying or unfolding
itself, except in the kindly form of homely charity.
The power was now about to be breathed upon it which
should quicken it into the mightiest energy of human
goodness.</p>

<p>He thus records the grievances he now began to grow
ardent for removing: “The distress of prisoners, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
which there are few who have not some imperfect idea,
came more immediately under my notice when I was
sheriff of the county of Bedford; and the circumstance
which excited me to activity in their behalf was, the
seeing some, who by the verdict of juries were declared
<em>not guilty</em>—some, on whom the grand jury did not find
such an appearance of guilt as subjected them to trial—and
some whose prosecutors did not appear against them—after
having been confined for months, dragged back
to gaol, and locked up again till they could pay <em>sundry
fees</em> to the gaoler, the clerk of assize, &amp;c. In order to
redress this hardship, I applied to the justices of the
county for a salary to the gaoler in lieu of his fees. The
bench were properly affected with the grievance, and
willing to grant the relief desired; but they wanted a
precedent for charging the county with the expense. I
therefore rode into several neighbouring counties in
search of a precedent; but I soon learned that the same
injustice was practised in them; and looking into the
prisons, I beheld scenes of calamity which I grew daily
more and more anxious to alleviate.” How free from
violence of emotion and exaggerated expression is his
statement; how calmly, rationally, and thoughtfully he
commenced his glorious enterprise!</p>

<p>He commences, soon after this, a series of journeys
for the inspection of English prisons; and visits, successively,
the gaols of Cambridge, Huntingdon, Northampton,
Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Stafford, Warwick,
Worcester, Gloucester, Oxford, and Buckingham. In
many of the gaols he found neither court-yard, water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
beds, nor even straw, for the use of the prisoners: no
sewers, most miserable provisions, and those extremely
scanty, and the whole of the rooms gloomy, filthy, and
loathsome. The greatest oppressions and cruelties were
practised on the wretched inmates: they were heavily
ironed for trivial offences, and frequently confined in
dungeons under ground. The Leicester gaol presented
more inhuman features than any other; the free ward
for debtors who could not afford to pay for better accommodation,
was a long dungeon called a cellar, down
seven steps—damp, and having but two windows in it,
the largest about a foot square; the rooms in which the
felons were confined night and day were also dungeons
from five to seven steps under ground.</p>

<p>In the course of another tour he visited the gaols of
Hertford, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, Hampshire,
and Sussex; set out again to revisit the prisons of the
Midlands; spent a fortnight in viewing the gaols of
London and Surrey; and then went once more on the
same great errand of mercy into the west of England.
Shortly after his return he was examined before a Committee
of the whole House of Commons, gave full and
satisfactory answers to the questions proposed to him,
and was then called before the bar of the House to
receive from the Speaker the assurance “that the House
were very sensible of the humanity and zeal which had
led him to visit the several gaols of this kingdom, and
to communicate to the House the interesting observations
he had made upon that subject.”</p>

<p>The intention of the Legislature to proceed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
correction of prison abuses, which the noble philanthropist
might infer from this expression of thanks, did
not cause him to relax in the pursuit of the high mission
he was now so earnestly entered upon. After examining
thoroughly the shameless abuses of the Marshalsea, in
London, he proceeded to Durham, from thence through
Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and
Lancashire, and inspected not only the prisons in those
counties, but a third time went through the degraded
gaols of the Midlands. A week’s rest at Cardington,
and away he departs to visit the prisons in Kent, and to
examine all he had not yet entered in London. North
and South Wales and the gaols of Chester, and again
Worcester and Oxford, he next surveys, and discovers
another series of subjects for the exertion of his
benevolence.</p>

<p>“Seeing,” says he, in his uniform and characteristic
vein of modesty, “in two or three of the <em>county gaols</em>
some poor creatures whose aspect was singularly deplorable,
and asking the cause of it, I was answered they
were lately brought from the <em>Bridewells</em>. This started
a fresh subject of inquiry. I resolved to inspect the
Bridewells; and for that purpose I travelled again into
the counties where I had been, and indeed into all the
rest, examining <em>houses of correction and city and town
gaols</em>. I beheld in many of them, as well as in county
gaols, a complication of distress; but my attention was
particularly fixed by the gaol-fever and small-pox which
I saw prevailing to the destruction of multitudes, not
only of felons in their dungeons, but of debtors also.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
His holy mission now comprehended for the philanthropist
the enterprise of lessening the disease as well as
unjust and inhuman treatment of prisoners.</p>

<p>The most striking scene of wrong detailed in any of
his narratives is in the account of the “Clink” prison of
Plymouth, a part of the town gaol. This place was
seventeen feet by eight, and five feet and a half high.
It was utterly dark, and had no air except what could
be derived through an extremely small wicket in the
door. To this wicket, the dimensions of which were
about seven inches by five, three prisoners under sentence
of transportation came by turns to breathe, being confined
in that wretched hole for nearly two months.
When Howard visited this place the door had not been
opened for five weeks. With considerable difficulty he
entered, and with deeply wounded feelings beheld an
emaciated human being, the victim of barbarity, who
had been confined there ten weeks. This unfortunate
creature, who was under sentence of transportation,
declared to the humane visitor who thus risked his
health and was happy to forego ease and comfort to
relieve the oppressed sufferer, that he would rather
have been hanged than thrust into that loathsome
dungeon.</p>

<p>The electors of Bedford, two years after Howard had
held the shrievalty of their county, urged him to become
a candidate for the representation of their borough in
Parliament. He gave a reluctant consent, but through
unfair dealing was unsuccessful. We may, for a moment,
regret that the great philanthropist was not permitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
to introduce into the Legislature of England measures
for the relief of the oppressed suggested by his own large
sympathies and experience; but it was far better that he
was freed from the shackles of attendance on debates,
and spared for ministration not only to the sufferings of
the injured in England but in Europe.</p>

<p>He had long purposed to give to the world in a printed
form the result of his laborious investigations into the
state of prisons in this country; but “conjecturing,” he
says, “that something useful to his purpose might be
collected abroad, he laid aside his papers and travelled
into France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany.” We
have omitted to state that he had already visited many
of the prisons in Scotland and Ireland. At Paris he
gained admission to some of the prisons with extreme
difficulty; but to get access to the state prisons the
jealousy of the governments rendered it almost impossible,
and under any circumstances dangerous. The intrepid
heart of Howard, however, was girt up to adventure, and
he even dared to attempt an entrance into the infamous
Bastille itself! “I knocked hard,” he says, “at the
outer gate, and immediately went forward through the
guard to the drawbridge before the entrance of the
castle; but while I was contemplating this gloomy
mansion, an officer came out of the castle much surprised,
and I was forced to retreat through the mute
guard, and thus regained that freedom, which, for one
locked up within those walls, it would be next to impossible
to obtain.” In the space of four centuries, from
the foundation to the destruction of the Bastille, it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
been observed that Howard was the only person ever
compelled to quit it with reluctance.</p>

<p>By taking advantage of some regulations of the Paris
Parliament, he succeeded in gaining admission to other
prisons, and found even greater atrocities committed
there than in the very worst gaols in England. Flanders
presented a striking contrast. “However rigorous they
may be,” says he, speaking of the regulations for the
prisons of Brussels, “yet their great care and attention
to their prisons is worthy of commendation: all fresh
and clean, no gaol distemper, no prisoners ironed. The
bread allowance far exceeds that of any of our gaols;
every prisoner here has two pounds of bread per day,
soup once every day, and on Sunday one pound of meat.”
He notes afterwards that he “carefully visited some
Prussian, Austrian, and Hessian gaols,” and “with the
utmost difficulty” gained access to “many dismal
abodes” of prisoners.</p>

<p>Returning to England, he travelled through every
county repursuing his mission, and after devoting three
months to a renewed inspection of the London prisons
again set out for the continent. Our space will not allow
of a record of the numerous evils he chronicles in these
renewed visits. The prisoners of Switzerland, but more
than all, of Holland, afforded him a relief to the vision
of horrors he witnessed elsewhere. We must find room
for some judicious observations he makes on his return
from this tour. “When I formerly made the tour of
Europe,” are his words, “I seldom had occasion to envy
foreigners anything I saw with respect to their <em>situation</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
their <em>religion</em>, <em>manners</em>, or <em>government</em>. In my late
journeys to view their <em>prisons</em> I was sometimes put to
the blush for my native country. The reader will
scarcely feel, from my narration, the same emotions of
shame and regret as the comparison excited in me on
beholding the difference with my own eyes; but from
the account I have given him of foreign prisons, he may
judge whether a design for reforming their own be
merely visionary—whether <em>idleness</em>, <em>debauchery</em>, <em>disease</em>,
and <em>famine</em>, be the necessary attendants of a prison, or
only connected with it in our ideas for want of a more
perfect knowledge and more enlarged views. I hope,
too, that he will do me the justice to think that neither
an indiscriminate admiration of every thing foreign, nor
a fondness for censuring every thing at home, has influenced
me to adopt the language of a panegyrist in this
part of my work, or that of a complainant in the rest.
Where I have commended I have mentioned my reasons
for so doing; and I have dwelt, perhaps, more minutely
upon the management of foreign prisons because it was
more agreeable to praise than to condemn. Another
motive induced me to be very particular in my accounts
of <em>foreign houses of correction</em>, especially those of the
freest states. It was to counteract a notion prevailing
among us that compelling prisoners to work, especially
in public, was inconsistent with the principles of English
liberty; at the same time that taking away the lives of
such numbers, either by executions or the diseases of our
prisons, seems to make little impression upon us; of
such force are custom and prejudice in silencing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
voice of good sense and humanity. I have only to add
that, fully sensible of the imperfections which must
attend the cursory survey of a traveller, it was my study
to remedy that defect by a constant attention to the one
object of my pursuit alone during the whole of my two
last journeys abroad.”</p>

<p>He did not allow himself a single day’s rest on returning
to England, but immediately recommenced his work
here. He notes some pleasing improvements, particularly
in the Nottingham gaol, since his last preceding
visit; but narrates other discoveries of a most revolting
description. The gaol at Knaresborough was in the
ruined castle, and had but two rooms without a window.
The keeper lived at a distance, there being no accommodation
for him in the prison. The debtors’ gaol was
horrible; it consisted of only one room difficult of access,
had an earthen floor, no fire-place, and there was a
common sewer from the town running through it uncovered!
In this miserable and disgusting hole Howard
learned that an officer had been confined some years
before, who took with him his dog to defend him from
vermin: his face was, however, much disfigured by their
attacks, and the dog was actually destroyed by them.</p>

<p>At length he prepared to print his “State of the
Prisons of England and Wales, with preliminary observations,
and an Account of some Foreign Prisons.” In
this laborious and valuable work, he was largely assisted
by the excellent Dr. Aikin, a highly congenial mind;
and it was completed in a form which, even in a literary
point of view, makes it valuable. The following very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
brief extract from it, is full of golden reflection: “Most
gentlemen who, when they are told of the misery which
our prisoners suffer, content themselves with saying,
‘<em>Let them take care to keep out</em>,’ prefaced, perhaps, with
an angry prayer, seem not duly sensible of the favour of
Providence, which distinguishes them from the sufferers:
they do not remember that we are required to imitate
our gracious Heavenly Parent, who is ‘<em>kind to the unthankful
and the evil</em>!’ They also forget the vicissitudes
of human affairs; the unexpected changes, to which all
men are liable; and that those whose circumstances are
affluent, may, in time, be reduced to indigence, and
become debtors and prisoners.”</p>

<p>As soon as his book was published he presented copies
of it to most of the principal persons in the kingdom,—thus
devoting his wealth, in another form, to the cause
of humanity. When it is recounted that he had not
only spent large sums in almost incessant travelling,
during four years, but had paid the prison fees of numbers
who could not otherwise have been liberated,
although their periods of sentence had transpired, some
idea may be formed of the heart that was within this
great devotee of mercy and goodness—the purest of all
worships.</p>

<p>The spirits of all reflecting men were roused by this
book: the Parliament passed an act for the better regulation
of the “hulk” prisons; and on Howard’s visiting
the hulks and detecting the evasions practised by the
superintendents, the government proceeded to rectify the
abuses. Learning that government projected further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
prison reforms, he again set out for the continent to
gain additional information in order to lay it before the
British Parliament. An accident at the Hague confined
him to his room for six weeks, by throwing him into an
inflammatory fever; but he was no sooner recovered
than he proceeded to enter on his work anew, by
visiting the prison at Rotterdam,—departing thence
through Osnaburgh and Hanover, into Germany, Prussia,
Bohemia, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and back through
France, again reaching England. Not to enumerate
any of his statements respecting his prison visits, let us
point the young reader to the answer he gave to Prince
Henry of Prussia, who, in the course of his first conversation
with the earnest philanthropist, asked him
whether he ever went to any public place in the evening,
after the labours of the day were over. “Never,” he
replied, “as I derive more pleasure from doing my duty
than from any amusement whatever.” What a thorough
putting-on of the great martyr spirit there was in the
life of this pure-souled man!</p>

<p>Listen, too, to the evidence of his careful employment
of the faculty of reason, while thus enthusiastically devoted
to the tenderest offices of humanity: “I have
frequently been asked what precautions I used to preserve
myself from infection in the prisons and hospitals
which I visit. I here answer once for all, that next to
the free goodness and mercy of the Author of my being,
temperance and cleanliness are my preservatives. Trusting
in Divine Providence, and being myself in the way
of my duty, I visit the most noxious cells, and while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
thus employed ‘<em>I fear no evil</em>!’ I never enter an
hospital or prison before breakfast, and in an offensive
room I seldom draw my breath deeply.”</p>

<p>Mark his intrepid championship of Truth, too, as well
as of Mercy. He was dining at Vienna, with the English
ambassador to the Austrian court, and one of the
ambassador’s party, a German, had been uttering some
praises of the Emperor’s abolition of torture. Howard
declared it was only to establish a worse torture, and
instanced an Austrian prison which, he said, was “as
bad as the black hole at Calcutta,” and that prisoners
were only taken from it when they confessed what was
laid to their charge. “Hush!” said the English ambassador
(Sir Robert Murray Keith), “your words will
be reported to his Majesty!” “What!” exclaimed
Howard, “shall my tongue be tied from speaking
truth by any king or emperor in the world? I repeat
what I asserted, and maintain its veracity.” Profound
silence ensued, and “every one present,” says Dr.
Brown, “admired the intrepid boldness of the man of
humanity.”</p>

<p>Another return to England, another survey of prisons
here, and he sets out on his fourth continental tour of
humanity, travelling through Denmark, Sweden, Russia,
Poland, and then, again, Holland and Germany.
Another general and complete revisitation of prisons in
England followed, and then a fifth continental pilgrimage
of goodness through Portugal, Spain, France, the
Netherlands, and Holland. During his absence from
England this time, his friends proposed to erect a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
monument to him; but he was gloriously great in humility
as in truth, benevolence, and intrepidity. “Oh, why
could not my friends,” says he, in writing to them, “who
know how much I detest such parade, have stopped
such a hasty measure?... It deranges and confounds
all my schemes. My exaltation is my fall—my
misfortune.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp35" id="i_b_139" style="max-width: 22.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_139.jpg" alt="John Howard.">
</figure>

<p>He summed up the number of miles he had travelled
for the reform of prisons, on his return to England after
his journey, and another re-examination of the prisons
at home, and found that the total was 42,033. Glorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
<em>perseverance</em>! But he is away again! having found a
new object for the yearnings of his ever-expanding heart.
He conceived, from inquiries of his medical friends, that
that most dreadful scourge of man’s race—the plague—could
be arrested in its destructive course. He visits
Holland, France, Italy, Malta, Zante, the Levant,
Turkey, Venice, Austria, Germany, and returns also by
Holland to England. The narrative glows with interest
in this tour; but the young reader—and how can he
resist it if he have a heart to love what is most deserving
of love—must turn to one of the larger biographies of
Howard for the circumstances. Alas! a stroke was
prepared for him on his return. His son, his darling
son, had become disobedient, progressed fearfully in vice,
and his father found him a raving maniac!</p>

<p>Howard’s only refuge from this poignant affliction
was in the renewal of the great mission of his life. He
again visited the prisons of Ireland and Scotland, and
left England to renew his humane course abroad, but
never to return. From Amsterdam this tour extended
to Cherson, in Russian Tartary. Attending one afflicted
with the plague there, he fell ill, and in a few days
breathed his last. He wished to be buried where he
died, and without pomp or monument: “Lay me quietly
in the earth,” said he; “place a sun-dial over my grave,
and let me be forgotten!” Who would not desire at
death that he had forgone every evanescent pleasure a
life of selfishness could bring, to live and die like John
Howard?</p>

<p class="no-indent">Work, and the true nobility of being devoted to it,
distinguished every exemplar recorded in our sketch;
and no name of eminence or excellence can be selected
in human annals who has ever used the phrase, which
can only console idiots, that “he is perfectly happy, for
he has nothing to do, and nothing to think about!”
“Nothing to do!” in a world whose elements are, as
yet, but partially subdued by man, and whose happiness
can be augmented so incalculably by the perfecting of
his dominion over Nature. “Nothing to think about!”
when language, and poetry, and art, and music, and
science, and invention, afford ecstatic occupation for
thought which could not be exhausted if a man’s life
were even extended on the earth to a million of years.
“Nothing to do, and nothing to think about!” while
millions are doing and thinking,—for a human creature
to profess that he derives pleasure from such a state of
consciousness, is to confess his willingness to be fed,
clothed, and attended by others, while he is meanly and
despicably indolent and degradingly dependent.</p>

<p>Young reader, spurn the indulgence of a thought so
unworthy of a human being! Remember, that happiness,
worth the name, can never be gained unless in the
discharge of duty, or under the sense of duty done.
And work is duty—thy duty—the duty of all mankind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Whatever may be a man’s situation, from the lowliest
to the highest he has a work to perform as a bounden
duty. Such was glorious Alfred’s conviction as a king:
such was Lackington’s conviction as a tradesman. For
every diversity of mind and genius the universe in which
we live affords work, and the peculiar work for which
each mind is filled becomes its bounden duty by natural
laws. “First of all we ought to do <em>our own duty</em>—but,
first of all,” were the memorable death-bed words of
Canova; and the conviction they expressed constituted
the soul-spring of every illustrious man’s life. The life
of Canova was—work: so was the life of Shakspere, of
Milton, of Jones, of Johnson, of Handel, of Davy, of
Watt, of Newton, of all-glorious Howard. Their lives
were “Triumphs of Perseverance:” even their deaths
did not lessen their triumphs. “Being dead, they yet
speak.” They are ever present with us in their great
words and thoughts, and in their great acts. Their
spirits thus still conjoin to purify and enlighten the
world: they are still transforming it, in some senses
more effectually than if still living, from ignorance, and
vice, and wrong and suffering, into a maturing sphere
of knowledge and might over Nature, and justice and
brotherhood. Let every earnest heart and mind be
resolved on treading in their footsteps, and aiding in
the realisation of the cheering trust that the world
shall yet be a universally happy world, and so man
reach that perfect consummation of the “<span class="smcap">Triumphs of
Perseverance</span>!”</p>

<p class="no-indent">Without Enterprise there would have been no civilization,
and there would now be no progress. To try, to
attempt, to pass beyond an obstacle, marks the civilized
man as distinguished from the savage. The advantage
of passing beyond a difficulty by a single act of trial has
offered itself, in innumerable instances, to the savage,
but in vain; it has passed him by unobserved, unheeded.
Nay, more: when led by the civilized man to partake of
the advantages of higher life, the savage has repeatedly
returned to his degradation. Thus it has often been
with the native Australian. A governor of the colony,
about sixty years ago, by an innocent stratagem took
one of the native warriors into his possession, and strove
to reconcile him to the habits of civilized life. Good
clothes and the best food were given him; he was treated
with the utmost kindness, and, when brought to England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
the attention of people of distinction was lavished
upon him. The Australian, however, was at length
relanded in his own country, when he threw away his
clothes as burdensome restraints upon his limbs, displayed
his ancient appetite for raw meat, and in all
respects became as rude as if he had never left his native
wilderness. Another trial was made by a humane
person, who procured two infants—a boy and a girl—believing
that such an early beginning promised sure
success. These young Australians were most carefully
trained, fed, and clothed, after the modes of civilized
Europe, and inured to the customs of our most improved
society. At twelve years old they were allowed to
choose their future life, when they rejected without hesitation
the enjoyments of education, and fled to their
people in the back-ground to share their famine, nakedness,
and cold.</p>

<p>A savage would perish in despair where the civilized
man would readily discover the mode of extricating
himself from difficulty; and yet, in point of physical
strength, it might be that the savage was superior.
Enterprise is thus clearly placed before the young reader
as a quality of mind. He may display it without being
gifted with strong corporeal power; it depends on
thought, reflection, calculation of advantage. Whoever
displays it is sure to be in some degree regarded with
attention by his fellow men; it wins a man the way to
public notice, and often to high reward, almost unfailingly.
But the purpose of the ensuing pages is not to
place false motives before the mind; to display any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
excellence with a view expressly to notice and reward
and not from the wish to do good or to perform a duty,
is unworthy of the truly correct man. The promptings
of duty and beneficence are evermore to be kept before
the mind as the only true guides to action.</p>

<p>In the instances of Enterprise presented in this little
volume, the young reader will not discover beneficence
to have been the invariable stimulant to action. Where
the actor displays a deficiency in the high quality of
mercy, the reader is recommended to think and judge
for himself. The instances have been selected for their
striking character, and the reader must class them justly.
Let him call courage by its right name; and when it is
not united with tenderness, let the act be weighed and
named at its true value.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The word “Enterprise,” which, it has just been observed,
marks the character of the civilized man as distinguished
from the savage, might also be used with some degree
of strictness to characterise man as distinguished from
the lower animals. Their instincts enable some of them,
as the bee and the beaver, to perform works of wondrous
ingenuity; but none of them step beyond what has been
the vocation of their species since it existed. The bounds
of human exertion, on the other hand, are apparently
illimitable. Its achievements in one generation, though
deemed wonderful, are outstripped in the next; and the
latest successful efforts of courage and skill serve to give
us confidence that much or all which yet baffles man’s
sagacity and power in the realm of nature shall be
eventually subjected to him; he is a being of Enterprise.</p>

<p>If endowed simply with bounded instincts he might
have remained the wild inhabitant of the forest covert,
or continued the rude tenant of the savage hut; his
limitless, or, at least, indefinite and ever-progressing
mental capacity, has empowered him to overcome
obstacle after obstacle in the way to his increasing
command over Nature; the triumphs of one generation
have been handed down to the next, and the aggregate
to those ages succeeding; and the catalogue of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
“Triumphs of Enterprise” would now form a library of
incalculable extent, since it would lead reflection into
every path of the dominions of history and natural
philosophy, of science and art.</p>

<p>The rudest display of this great characteristic of man
is the assertion of his superiority to the rest of the
animal world, and seems to offer a primary claim to
observation. The stronger and fiercer animals would
be the first enemies with which man had to struggle.
With his conquest of their strength and ferocity, and
subjection of some of their tribes to his use and service,
his empire must have begun. Had we authentic records
remaining of the earliest human essays towards taming
the dog, domesticating the cat, and training for beneficial
use or service the goat, the sheep, and the ox, the horse
and the elephant, the camel, the llama, and the reindeer,
such a chronicle would be filled with interest.
Fable, however, surrounds the scanty memorials that
remain of this as well as of higher departments of human
discovery in the primeval ages. Abundant material
exists in ancient history for a narrative of the more
exciting part of these triumphs—the successful display
of man’s courage as opposed to the mightier strength of
the more ferocious animals; but the accounts of such
adventures in later times are less doubtful, and a brief
recapitulation of a few of them will serve equally well to
introduce the “Triumphs of Enterprise.”</p>

<h3>GENERAL PUTNAM,</h3>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_150.jpg" alt="General Putnam">

<p class="no-indent">Who signalised his courage in the struggles with the
French on the continent of North America about the
middle of the last century, removed after the war to the
State of Connecticut. The wolves, then very numerous,
broke into his sheepfold, and killed seven fine sheep
and goats, besides wounding many lambs and kids. The
chief havoc was committed by a she-wolf, which, with
her annual litter of whelps, had infested the neighbourhood.
The young were generally destroyed by the
vigilance of the hunters, but the mother-wolf was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
wary to come within gun-shot, and upon being closely
pursued would fly to the western woods, and return the
next winter with another litter of whelps. This wolf
at length became such an intolerable nuisance that
Putnam entered into a combination with five of his
neighbours to hunt alternately until they could destroy
her; two, by rotation, were to be constantly in pursuit.
It was known that having lost the toes of one foot by a
steel trap she made one track shorter than the other.
By this peculiarity the pursuers recognised in a light
snow the route of this destructive animal. Having followed
her to Connecticut river and found that she had
turned back in a direct course towards Pomfret, they
immediately returned, and by ten o’clock the next morning
the bloodhounds had driven her into a den about
three miles from Putnam’s house. The people soon
collected with dogs, guns, straw, fire, and sulphur, to
attack the common enemy. With these materials several
unsuccessful efforts were made to force her from her
den; the dogs came back badly wounded, and refused to
return to the charge; the smoke of blazing straw had no
effect, nor did the fumes of burnt brimstone, with which
the cavern was filled, compel the wolf to quit her retirement.
Wearied with such fruitless attempts, which had
been continued until ten o’clock at night, Putnam tried
once more to make his dog enter, but in vain. He proposed
to his negro to go down into the cavern and shoot
the wolf, but the negro dared not. Then it was that
Putnam, declaring he would not have a coward in his
family, and angry at the disappointment, resolved himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
to destroy the ferocious beast or to perish in the attempt.
His neighbours strongly remonstrated against the perilous
undertaking; but he, knowing that wild animals
are intimidated by fire, and having provided several slips
of birch bark, the only combustible material which he
could obtain that would afford light in this deep and
darksome cave, prepared for his descent. Having
divested himself of his coat and waistcoat, and fixed
a strong rope round his body by which he might at
a concerted signal be drawn out of the cave, he fearlessly
entered head-foremost with the blazing torch in
his hand.</p>

<p>The aperture of the den, on the east side of a very
high ledge of rocks, was about two feet square; thence
it descended obliquely fifteen feet, then running horizontally
about ten more it ascended gradually sixteen
feet towards its termination. The sides of this subterranean
cavity were composed of smooth and solid rocks,
which seem to have been driven from each other by
some great convulsion of nature. The top and bottom
were of stone, and the entrance to it in winter being
covered with ice was exceedingly slippery. The cave
was difficult of access, being in no place high enough
for a man to stand upright, nor in any part more than
three feet wide.</p>

<p>Having groped his passage to the horizontal part of
the den, the most terrifying darkness appeared in front
of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. “It
was silent as the tomb; none but monsters of the desert
had ever before explored this solitary mansion of horror,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
says the relator. Putnam cautiously proceeded onward;
came to the ascent, which he mounted on his hands and
knees, and then discovered the glaring eyeballs of the
wolf, which was sitting at the extremity of the cavern.
Startled at the sight of the fire, she gnashed her teeth
and gave a sullen growl. As soon as he had made the
discovery he gave the signal for pulling him out of the
cavern. The people at the mouth of the den, who had
listened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of
the wolf, and supposing their friend to be in danger,
drew him forth with such quickness that his shirt was
stripped over his head and his body much lacerated.
After he had adjusted his clothes and loaded his gun
with nine buck shot, with a torch in one hand and his
musket in the other, he descended a second time. He
approached the wolf nearer than before. She assumed
a still more fierce and terrible appearance, howling,
rolling her eyes, and gnashing her teeth. At length,
dropping her head between her legs, she prepared to
spring upon him. At this critical moment he levelled
his piece and shot her in the head. Stunned with the
shock, and nearly suffocated with the smoke, he immediately
found himself drawn out of the cave. Having
refreshed himself and permitted the smoke to clear
away, he entered the terrible cave a third time, when
to his great satisfaction he found the wolf was dead;
he then took hold of her ears, and making the necessary
signal, the people above, with no small exultation,
drew the wolf and her conqueror both out
together.</p>

<p>From among the numerous records of successful encounter
with tigers, let us select that of</p>

<hr class="r33">

<h3>LIEUT. EVAN DAVIES,</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="i_b_154" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<p class="no-indent">Which occurred while the British army was lying at
Agoada, near Goa, 1809. A report was one morning
brought to the cantonment that a very large tiger had
been seen on the rocks near the sea. About nine o’clock
a number of horses and men assembled at the spot where
it was said to have been seen, when, after some search,
the animal was discovered to be in the recess of an
immense rock; dogs were sent in in the hope of starting
him, but without effect, having returned with several
wounds. Finding it impossible to dislodge the animal
by such means, Lieut. Davies, of the 7th regiment,
attempted to enter the den, but was obliged to return,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
finding the passage extremely narrow and dark. He
attempted it, however, a second time, with a pick-axe in
his hand, with which he removed some obstructions that
were in the way. Having proceeded a few yards he heard
a noise which he conceived to be that of the animal. He
then returned, and communicated with Lieut. Threw, of
the Artillery, who also went in the same distance, and
was of a similar opinion. What course to pursue was
doubtful. Some proposed to blow up the rock; others,
to smoke the animal out. At length a port-fire was tied
to the end of a bamboo, and introduced into a small
crevice which led towards the den. Lieut. Davies went
on hands and knees down the narrow passage which
led to it, and by the light of his torch he was enabled to
discover the animal. Having returned, he said he could
kill him with a pistol, which, being procured, he again
entered the cave and fired, but without success, owing to
the awkward situation in which he was placed, having
only his left hand at liberty. He next went with a
musket and bayonet, and wounded the tiger in the loins;
but he was obliged to retreat as quickly as the narrow
passage would allow, the tiger having rushed forward
and forced the musket back towards the mouth of the
den. Lieut. Davies next procured a rifle, with which
he again forced his way into the cave, and taking deliberate
aim at the tiger’s head, fired, and put an end to its
existence. He afterwards tied a strong rope round the
neck of the tiger, by which it was dragged out, to the
no small satisfaction of a numerous crowd of spectators.
The animal measured seven feet in length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Combats with wild elephants are still more dangerous
than with the tiger. From the following account given
by a sojourner in India, the extreme hazard attending
such enterprises will be seen, while a reflection can
scarcely fail to arise on the wondrous superiority of
man’s sagacity which has enabled him to reduce this
mightiest of land animals to docile servitude.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="i_b_156" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_156.jpg" alt="Elephant">
</figure>

<p>“We had intelligence,” says the narrator, “of an
immense wild elephant being in a large grass swamp
within five miles of us. He had inhabited the swamp
for years, and was the terror of the surrounding villagers,
many of whom he had killed. He had only one tusk;
and there was not a village for many miles round that
did not know the ‘Burrah ek durt ke Hathee,’ or the
large one-toothed elephant; and one of our party had
the year before been charged and his elephant put to
the right-about by this famous fellow. We determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
to go in pursuit of him; and accordingly on the third
day after our arrival, started in the morning, mustering,
between private and government elephants, thirty-two,
but seven of them only with sportsmen on their backs.
As we knew that in the event of the wild one charging
he would probably turn against the male elephants, the
drivers of two or three of the largest were armed with
spears. On our way to the swamp we shot a great
number of different sorts of game that got up before the
line of elephants, and had hardly entered the swamp
when, in consequence of one of the party firing at a
partridge, we saw the great object of our expedition.
The wild elephant got up out of some long grass about
two hundred and fifty yards before us, when he stood
staring at us and flapping his huge ears. We immediately
made a line of the elephants with the sportsmen in
the centre, and went straight up to him until within a
hundred and thirty yards, when, fearing he was going
to turn from us, all the party gave him a volley, some of
us firing two, three, and four barrels. He then turned
round, and made for the middle of the swamp. The
chase now commenced, and after following him upwards
of a mile, with our elephants up to their bellies in mud,
we succeeded in turning him to the edge of the swamp,
where he allowed us to get within eighty yards of him,
when we gave him another volley in his full front, on
which he made a grand charge at us, but fortunately
only grazed one of the pad elephants. He then made
again for the middle of the swamp, throwing up blood
and water from his trunk, and making a terrible noise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
which clearly showed that he had been severely wounded.
We followed him, and were obliged to swim our elephants
through a piece of deep stagnant water, occasionally
giving shot, when making a stop in some very high grass
he allowed us again to come within sixty yards, and got
another volley, on which he made a second charge more
furious than the first, but was prevented making it good
by some shots fired when very close to us, which stunned
and fortunately turned him. He then made for the
edge of the swamp, again swimming a piece of water,
through which we followed with considerable difficulty
in consequence of our pads and howdahs having become
much heavier from the soaking they had got twice before.
We were up to the middle in the howdahs, and one of
the elephants fairly turned over and threw the rider and
his guns into the water. He was taken off by one of
the pad elephants, but his three guns went to the bottom.
This accident took up some time, during which the wild
elephant had made his way to the edge of the swamp,
and stood perfectly still looking at us and trumpeting
with his trunk. As soon as we got all to rights we again
advanced with the elephants in the form of a crescent,
in the full expectation of a desperate charge, nor were
we mistaken. The animal now allowed us to come
within forty yards of him, when we took a very deliberate
aim at his head, and, on receiving this fire, he made
a most furious charge, in the act of which, and when
within ten yards of some of us, he received his mortal
wound and fell dead as a stone. His death-wound on
examination proved to be from a small ball over the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
eye, for this was the only one of thirty-one that he had
received in his head, which was found to have entered
the brain. When down he measured in height twelve
feet four inches; in length, from the root of the tail to
the top of the head, sixteen feet; and ten feet round the
neck. He had upwards of eighty balls in his head and
body. His only remaining tusk when taken out weighed
thirty-six pounds, and, when compared with the tusks of
tame elephants, was considered small for the size of the
animal. After he fell a number of villagers came about
us, and were rejoiced at the death of their formidable
enemy, and assured us that during the last four or five
years he had killed nearly fifty men; indeed, the knowledge
of the mischief he had occasioned was the only
thing which could reconcile us to the death of so noble
an animal.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Exciting as such accounts of contest with powerful
land animals are, they yield in depth of interest to the
records of the whale fishery. The potent combination
of human courage and intelligence is so fully manifested
by an excellent description of these daring but well
ordered enterprises, contained in one of the volumes of
the Edinburgh Cabinet Library, that we present it to
the young reader almost entire:—</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_160" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_160.jpg" alt="Whale and ships">
</figure>

<p>“As soon as they have arrived in those seas which
are the haunt of the whale, the crew must be every
moment on the alert, keeping watch day and night.
The seven boats are kept hanging by the sides of the
ship ready to be launched in a few minutes, and, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
the state of the sea admits, one of them is usually
manned and afloat. These boats are from twenty-five to
twenty-eight feet long, about five and a half feet broad,
and constructed with a special view to lightness, buoyancy,
and easy steerage. The captain or some principal
officer seated above surveys the water to a great distance,
and the instant he sees the back of the huge animal
which they seek to attack emerging from the waves, gives
notice to the watch who are stationed on deck, part of
whom leap into a boat, which is instantly lowered down,
and followed by a second if the fish be a large one. Each
of the boats has a harpooner and one or two subordinate
officers, and is provided with an immense quantity of
rope coiled together and stowed in different quarters of
it, the several parts being spliced together so as to form
a continued line usually exceeding four thousand feet in
length; to the end is attached the harpoon, an instrument
formed not to pierce and kill the animal, but by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
entering and remaining fixed in the body to prevent its
escape. One of the boats is now rowed towards the
whale in the deepest silence, cautiously avoiding to give
any alarm, of which he is very susceptible. Sometimes
a circuitous route is adopted in order to attack him from
behind. Having approached as near as is consistent
with safety, the harpooner darts his instrument into the
back of the monster. This is a critical moment, for
when this mighty animal feels himself struck he often
throws himself into violent convulsive movements,
vibrating in the air his tremendous tail, one lash of
which is sufficient to dash a boat in pieces. More commonly,
however, he plunges with rapid flight into the
depths of the sea or beneath the thickest fields and
mountains of ice. While he is thus moving, at the rate
usually of eight or ten miles an hour, the utmost diligence
must be used that the line to which the harpoon
is attached may run off smoothly and readily along with
him; should it be entangled for a moment the strength
of the whale is such that he would draw the boat and
crew after him under the waves. The first boat ought
to be quickly followed up by a second to supply more
line when the first is run out, which often takes place in
eight or ten minutes. When the crew of a boat see the
line in danger of being all run off, they hold up one,
two, or three oars, to intimate their pressing need of a
supply; at the same time they turn the rope once or
twice round a kind of post called the bollard, by which
the motion of the line and the career of the animal are
somewhat retarded. This, however, is a delicate operation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
which brings the side of the boat down to the very
edge of the water, and if the rope be drawn at all too
tight may sink it altogether. While the line is rolling
round the bollard the friction is so violent that the
harpooner is enveloped in smoke, and water must be
constantly poured on to prevent it catching fire. When,
after all, no aid arrives, and the crew find that the line
must run out, they have only one resource—they cut it,
losing thereby not only the whale but the harpoon and
all the ropes of the boat.</p>

<p>“When the whale is first struck and plunges into the
waves, the boat’s crew elevate a flag as a signal to the
watch on deck, who give the alarm to those asleep below
by stamping violently on the deck, and crying aloud,
‘A fall! a fall!’ On this notice they do not allow
themselves time to dress, but rush out in their sleeping-shirts
or drawers into an atmosphere the temperature of
which is often below zero, carrying along with them
their clothing in a bundle and trusting to make their
toilette in the interval of manning and pushing off the
boats. Such is the tumult at this moment that young
mariners have been known to raise cries of fear, thinking
the ship was going down.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_163" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_163.jpg" alt="Whirlpool">
</figure>

<p>The period during which a wounded whale remains
under water is various, but is averaged by Mr. Scoresby
at about half an hour. Then, pressed by the necessity
of respiration, he appears above, often considerably
distant from the spot where he was harpooned and in a
state of great exhaustion, which the same ingenious
writer ascribes to the severe pressure that he has endured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
when placed beneath a column of water seven hundred
or eight hundred fathoms deep. All the boats have
meantime been spreading themselves in various directions,
that one at least may be within a <em>start</em>, as it is
called, or about two hundred yards at the point of his
rising, at which distance they can easily pierce him with
one or two more harpoons before he again descends, as
he usually does for a few minutes. On his reappearance
a general attack is made with lances, which are struck
as deep as possible to reach and penetrate the vital parts.
Blood mixed with oil streams copiously from his wounds
and from his blow-holes, dyeing the sea to a great distance,
and sprinkling and sometimes drenching the
boats and crews. The animal now becomes more and
more exhausted, but at the approach of his death he
often makes a convulsive and energetic struggle, rearing
his tail high in the air, and whirling it with a noise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
which is heard at the distance of several miles. At
length, quite overpowered and exhausted, he lays himself
on his side or back and expires. The flag is then taken
down, and three loud huzzas raised from the surrounding
boats. No time is lost in piercing the tail with two
holes, through which ropes are passed, which, being
fastened to the boats, drag the fish to the vessel amid
shouts of joy.</p>

<p>One reflection must arise in the mind of the young
reader—if he have begun to reflect—on reading this
brief description of whale fishery enterprise. Man’s
attack upon the whale is <em>not</em> an act of self-defence; is it,
then, justifiable? We cannot go into the whole argument
which would present itself when such an important
question is asked. We leave the reader to grapple with
the difficulty as a healthy exercise for his understanding,
only reminding him that the conveniences of civilization
in the degree hitherto reached would be immensely curtailed
if Man were not allowed to sacrifice for his own
use the lives of animals which, either by their gentle
nature or the localities they occupy, are without the
range of the noxious and dangerous class.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Equally early with their contests with wild animals
primeval men would have had to encounter peril, and to
overcome difficulty in the fulfilment of the natural desire
possessed by some of them to visit new regions of the
earth. Even if the theory be true which is supported
by hundreds of learned volumes, that man’s first habitation
was in the most agreeable and fertile portion of
Asia, by the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, the
native characteristic of enterprise would impel some
among the first men to go in quest of new homes or on
journeys of exploration and adventure; and, as the
human family increased, removal for the youthful
branches would be absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>To these primal travellers the perils of unknown
adventure and the pressure of want would most probably
have proved excitements too absorbing to have permitted
a chronicle of their experience, even had the art of
writing then existed. But details of adventure as wild
and strange, perhaps, as any encountered by those earliest
travellers exist in the volumes of recent discoverers;
and while glancing at these we may imagine to ourselves
similar enterprises of our race in the thousands of years
which are past and gone. Let it be observed, in passing,
that the young reader will find no books more rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
and varied in interest than those of intelligent travellers;
and if our slight mention of a few of their names as
partakers in the “Triumphs of Enterprise” should
induce him to form a larger acquaintance with their
narratives, it can scarcely fail to induce thoughts and
resolves that will tend to his advantage.</p>

<p>The perils to be undergone in desert regions are not
more forcibly described by any travellers than by Major
Denham, Dr. Oudney, and Captain Clapperton, the celebrated
African discoverers. “The sand-storm we had
the misfortune to encounter in crossing the desert,” says
the former, “gave us a pretty correct idea of the dreaded
effects of these hurricanes. The wind raised the fine
sand with which the extensive desert was covered so as
to fill the atmosphere and render the immense space
before us impenetrable to the eye beyond a few yards.
The sun and clouds were entirely obscured, and a suffocating
and oppressive weight accompanied the flakes
and masses of sand which, I had almost said, we had to
penetrate at every step. At times we completely lost
sight of the camels, though only a few yards before us.
The horses hung their tongues out of their mouths, and
refused to face the torrents of sand. A sheep that accompanied
the kafila (the travelling train), the last of
our stock, lay down on the road, and we were obliged to
kill him and throw the carcass on a camel. A parching
thirst oppressed us, which nothing alleviated. We had
made but little way by three o’clock in the afternoon,
when the wind got round to the eastward and refreshed
us a little; with this change we moved on until about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
five, when we halted, protected in a measure by some
hills. As we had but little wood our fare was confined
to tea, and we hoped to find relief from our fatigues by
a sound sleep. That, however, was denied us; the tent
had been imprudently pitched, and was exposed to the
east wind, which blew a hurricane during the night; the
tent was blown down, and the whole detachment were
employed a full hour in getting it up again. Our bedding
and every thing within the tent was during that time
completely buried by the constant driving of the sand.
I was obliged three times during the night to get up for
the purpose of strengthening the pegs; and when in
the morning I awoke two hillocks of sand were formed
on each side of my head some inches high.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Dr. Oudney, the partner of Denham and Clapperton,
in their adventurous enterprise, affords details more
frightful in character. “Strict orders had been given
during a certain day of the journey,” he informs us,
“for the camels to keep close up, and for the Arabs not
to straggle—the Tibboo Arabs having been seen on the
look out. During the last two days,” he continues,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
“we had passed on the average from sixty to eighty or
ninety skeletons each day; but the numbers that lay
about the wells of El-Hammar were countless; those
of two women, whose perfect and regular teeth bespoke
them young, were particularly shocking—their arms
still remained clasped round each other as they had
expired, although the flesh had long since perished by
being exposed to the burning rays of the sun, and the
blackened bones only were left; the nails of the fingers
and some of the sinews of the hand also remained, and
part of the tongue of one of them still appeared through
the teeth. We had now passed six days of desert without
the slightest appearance of vegetation, and a little
branch was brought me here as a comfort and curiosity.
A few roots of dry grass, blown by the winds towards
the travellers, were eagerly seized on by the Arabs,
with cries of joy, for their hungry camels. Soon after
the sun had retired behind the hills to the west, we descended
into a wadey, where about a dozen stunted
bushes, not trees, of palm marked the spot where water
was to be found. The wells were so choked up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
sand, that several cart-loads of it were removed previous
to finding sufficient water; and even then the animals
could not drink till nearly ten at night.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Nor was it merely the horrors of the climate which
these intrepid travellers had to encounter. Their visitation
of various savage tribes drew them into the circle
of barbarous quarrels. The peril incurred by Major
Denham, while accompanying the Bornou warriors in
their expedition against the Felatahs, is unsurpassed for
interest in any book of travels. “My horse was badly
wounded in the neck, just above the shoulder, and in
the near hind leg,” says the Major, describing what had
befallen himself and steed in the encounter; “an arrow
had struck me in the face as it passed, merely drawing
the blood. If either of my horse’s wounds had been
from poisoned arrows I felt that nothing could save me
[The tribe he accompanied had been worsted.] However,
there was not much time for reflection; we instantly
became a flying mass, and plunged, in the greatest disorder,
into that wood we had but a few hours before
moved through with order, and very different feelings.
The spur had the effect of incapacitating my beast altogether,
as the arrow, I found afterwards, had reached the
shoulder-bone, and in passing over some rough ground
he stumbled and fell. Almost before I was on my legs
the Felatahs were upon me; I had, however, kept hold
of the bridle, and, seizing a pistol from the holsters, I
presented it at two of these ferocious savages, who were
pressing me with their spears: they instantly went off;
but another, who came on me more boldly, just as I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
endeavouring to mount, received the contents somewhere
in his left shoulder, and again I was enabled to place
my foot in the stirrup. Re-mounted, I again pushed
my retreat; I had not, however, proceeded many hundred
yards when my horse came down again, with such
violence as to throw me against a tree at a considerable
distance; and, alarmed at the horses behind, he quickly
got up and escaped, leaving me on foot and unarmed.
A chief and his four followers were here butchered and
stripped; their cries were dreadful, and even now the
feelings of that moment are fresh in my memory; my
hopes of life were too faint to deserve the name. I was
almost instantly surrounded, and incapable of making
the least resistance, as I was unarmed. I was as speedily
stripped; and, whilst attempting first to save my
shirt and then my trousers, I was thrown on the
ground. My pursuers made several thrusts at me with
their spears, that badly wounded my hands in two
places, and slightly my body, just under my ribs, on the
right side; indeed I saw nothing before me but the
same cruel death I had seen unmercifully inflicted on
the few who had fallen into the power of those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
now had possession of me. My shirt was now absolutely
torn off my back, and I was left perfectly
naked.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_170" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_170.jpg" alt="Battle">
</figure>

<p>“When my plunderers began to quarrel for the spoil,
the idea of escape came like lightning across my mind,
and, without a moment’s hesitation or reflection, I crept
under the belly of the horse nearest me, and started as
fast as my legs could carry me for the thickest part of
the wood. Two of the Felatahs followed, and I ran on
to the eastward, knowing that our stragglers would be
in that direction, but still almost as much afraid of
friends as of foes. My pursuers gained on me, for the
prickly underwood not only obstructed my passage but
tore my flesh miserably; and the delight with which I
saw a mountain-stream gliding along at the bottom of a
deep ravine cannot be imagined. My strength had
almost left me, and I seized the young branches issuing
from the stump of a large tree which overhung the
ravine, for the purpose of letting myself down into the
water, as the sides were precipitous, when, under my
hand, as the branch yielded to the weight of my body,
a large <em>liffa</em>, the worst kind of serpent this country
produces, rose from its coil, as if in the act of striking.
I was horror-stricken, and deprived for a moment of all
recollection; the branch slipped from my hand, and I
tumbled headlong into the water beneath; this shock,
however, revived me, and with three strokes of my arms
I reached the opposite bank, which with difficulty I
crawled up, and then, for the first time, felt myself
safe from my pursuers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Scarcely had I audibly congratulated myself on my
escape, when the forlorn and wretched situation in which
I was, without even a rag to cover me, flashed with all
its force upon my imagination. I was perfectly collected,
though fully alive to all the danger to which my
state exposed me, and had already began to plan my
night’s rest in the top of one of the tamarind trees, in
order to escape the panthers, which, as I had seen,
abounded in these woods, when the idea of the <em>liffas</em>,
almost as numerous and equally to be dreaded, excited
a shudder of despair.</p>

<p>“I now saw horsemen through the trees, still farther
to the east, and determined on reaching them if possible,
whether friends or enemies. They were friends. I
hailed them with all my might; but the noise and confusion
which prevailed, from the cries of those who
were falling under the Felatah spears, the cheers of the
Arabs rallying and their enemies pursuing, would have
drowned all attempts to make myself heard, had not the
sheikh’s negro seen and known me at a distance. To
this man I was indebted for my second escape: riding
up to me, he assisted me to mount behind him, while
the arrows whistled over our heads, and we then galloped
off to the rear as fast as his wounded horse could
carry us. After we had gone a mile or two, and the
pursuit had cooled, I was covered with a bornouse; this
was a most welcome relief, for the burning sun had
already begun to blister my neck and back, and gave
me the greatest pain; and had we not soon arrived
at water I do not think it possible that I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
have supported the thirst by which I was being
consumed.”</p>

<p>The exciting narrative of travel in the central regions
of Africa the young reader may pursue in various
volumes, from those describing the adventures of Leo
Africanus, in 1513, to the narrative of the intrepid
career of Mungo Park, in 1796. From the dangers of
travel in the torrid zone the spirit of contrast would
direct us to a glance at the perils of adventure in the
arctic. Here a pile of books written by men of science
await us; but, unfortunately, many of them, like the
volumes of Maupertuis and Pallas, though rich in details
of natural philosophy or natural history, possess little
interest as narratives of adventure. Their authors had
little or none of the true heroic spirit of the man of enterprise,
who never courts ease when the way of danger
is the real path to entire knowledge. The spirit of Dr.
Edward Daniel Clarke marks more accurately the proper
constitution of the traveller united with the tendencies
of the man of science. He had resolved to attempt reaching
the North Pole; but having arrived at Enontakis,
in latitude 68 degrees, 30 min., 30 sec., N., he was seized
with illness, and obliged to return to the south. He
thus writes to his mother, from Enontakis:—</p>

<p>“We have found the cottage of a priest in this remote
corner of the world, and have been snug with him
a few days. Yesterday I launched a balloon, eighteen
feet in height, which I had made to attract the natives.
You may guess their astonishment when they saw it
rise from the earth. Is it not famous to be here within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
the frigid zone, more than two degrees within the arctic,
and nearer to the pole than the most northern shores of
Iceland? For a long time darkness has been a stranger
to us. The sun, as yet, passes not below the horizon,
but he dips his crimson visage behind a mountain to the
north. This mountain we ascended, and had the satisfaction
to see him make his courtesy without setting.
At midnight the priest of this place lights his pipe,
during three weeks of the year, by means of a burning-glass,
from the sun’s rays.”</p>

<p>Of all travellers in the northern regions, though not
the most intellectual, the hardiest and most adventurous
is Captain Cochrane. He had originally intended to
devote himself to African discovery, conceiving himself
competent for that arduous undertaking, by experience
of the fatigues he had borne in laborious pedestrian
journeys through France, Spain, and Portugal, and in
Canada. “The plan I proposed to follow,” says he,
“was nearly that adopted by Mungo Park, in his first
journey—intending to proceed alone, and requiring only
to be furnished with the countenance of some constituent
part of the government. With this protection, and
such recommendation as it would procure me, I would
have accompanied the caravans in some servile capacity,
nor hesitated even to sell myself as a slave, if that
miserable alternative were necessary, to accomplish the
object I had in view. In going alone, I relied upon my
own individual exertions and knowledge of man, unfettered
by the frailties and misconduct of others. I was
then, as now, convinced that many people travelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
together for the purpose of exploring a barbarous
country, have the less chance of succeeding; more especially
when they go armed, and take with them presents
of value. The appearance of numbers must naturally
excite the natives to resistance, from motives of
jealousy or fear; and the danger would be greatly increased
by the hope of plunder.”</p>

<p>The answer he received from the Admiralty being unfavourable,
and thinking that a young commander was
not likely to be employed in active service, he planned
for himself a journey on foot round the globe, as nearly
as it could be accomplished by land, intending to cross
from northern Asia to America at Behring’s Straits.
Captain Cochrane did not realise his first intent, but he
tracked the breadth of the entire continent of Asia to
Kamtschatka. Hazards and dangers befel him frequently
in this enterprise; but he pursued it undauntedly. His
perils commenced when he had left St. Petersburg but
a few days, and had not reached Novogorod.</p>

<p>“From Tosna my route was towards Linbane,” says
our adventurer, “at about the ninth milestone from
which I sat down, to smoke a cigar or pipe, as fancy
might dictate. I was suddenly seized from behind by
two ruffians, whose visages were as much concealed as
the oddness of their dress would permit. One of them,
who held an iron bar in his hand, dragged me by the
collar towards the forest, while the other, with a bayonetted
musket, pushed me on in such a manner as to
make me move with more than ordinary celerity; a boy,
auxiliary to these vagabonds, was stationed on the roadside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
to keep a look-out. We had got some sixty or
eighty paces into the thickest part of the forest, when I
was desired to undress, and having stripped off my
trousers and jacket, then my shirt, and finally my shoes
and stockings, they proceeded to tie me to a tree. From
this ceremony, and from the manner of it, I fully concluded
that they intended to try the effect of a musket
upon me, by firing at me as they would at a mark. I
was, however, reserved for fresh scenes; the villains,
with much <em>sang froid</em>, seated themselves at my feet, and
rifled my knapsack and pockets, even cutting out the
linings of the clothes in search of bank bills or some
other valuable articles. They then compelled me to
take at least a pound of black bread, and a glass of rum,
poured from a small flask which had been suspended
from my neck. Having appropriated my trousers,
shirts, stockings, and shoes, as also my spectacles, watch,
compass, thermometer, and small pocket sextant, with
one hundred and sixty roubles (about seven pounds),
they at length released me from the tree, and, at the
point of a stiletto, made me swear that I would not
inform against them—such, at least, I conjectured to be
their meaning, though of their language I understood
not a word. Having received my promise, I was again
treated by them to bread and rum, and once more fastened
to the tree, in which condition they finally abandoned
me. Not long after, a boy who was passing
heard my cries, and set me at liberty. With the remnant
of my apparel, I rigged myself in Scotch Highland
fashion, and resumed my route. I had still left me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
blue jacket, a flannel waistcoat, and a spare one, which
I tied round my waist in such a manner that it reached
down to the knees; my empty knapsack was restored to
its old place, and I trotted on with even a merry heart.”</p>

<p>He comes up with a file of soldiers in the course of a
few miles and is relieved with some food, but declines
the offer of clothes. A carriage is also offered to convey
him to the next military station. “But I soon discovered,”
he continues, “that riding was too cold, and
therefore preferred walking, barefooted as I was; and
on the following morning I reached Tschduvo, one hundred
miles from St. Petersburg.” At Novogorod he is
further relieved by the governor, and accepts from him
a shirt and trousers.</p>

<p>He reaches Moscow without a renewal of danger, and
thence Vladimir and Pogost. In the latter town he
cheerfully makes his bed in a style that shows he possessed
the spirit of an adventurer in perfection. “Being
too jaded to proceed farther,” are his words, “I thought
myself fortunate in being able to pass the night in a
<em>cask</em>. Nor did I think this mode of passing the night
a novel one. Often, very often, have I, in the fastnesses
of Spain and Portugal, reposed in similar style.” He
even selects exposure to the open air for sleep when it
is in his power to accept indulgence. “Arrived at
Nishney Novogorod, the Baron Bode,” says he, “received
me kindly, placing me for board in his own
house; while for lodging I preferred the open air of his
garden: there, with my knapsack for a pillow, I passed
the night more pleasantly than I should have done on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
a bed of down, which the baron pressed me most sincerely
to accept.” A man who thus hardened himself
against indulgence could scarcely dread any of the hardships
so inevitable in the hazardous course he had
marked out for himself.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find him exciting the wonder of the
natives by his hardihood, in the very heart of Siberia.
“At Irkutsk,” is his own relation, “in the month of
January, with forty degrees of Reaumur, I have gone
about, late and early, either for exercise or amusement,
to balls or dinners, yet did I never use any other kind
of clothing than I do now in the streets of London.
Thus my readers must not suppose my situation to have
been so desperate. It is true, the natives felt surprised,
and pitied my apparently forlorn and hopeless situation,
not seeming to consider that, when the mind and body
are in constant motion, the elements can have little
effect upon the person. I feel confident that most of
the miseries of human life are brought about by want
of a solid education—of firm reliance on a bountiful
and ever-attendant Providence—of a spirit of perseverance—of
patience under fatigue and privations, and
a resolute determination to hold to the point of duty,
never to shrink while life retains a spark, or while ‘a
shot is in the locker,’ as sailors say. Often, indeed,
have I felt myself in difficult and trying circumstances,
from cold, or hunger, or fatigue; but I may affirm, with
gratitude, that I have never felt happier than even in
the encountering of these difficulties.” He remarks,
soon afterwards, that he has never seen his constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
equalled; but the young reader will remember that the
undaunted adventurer has strikingly shown us how this
excellent constitution was preserved from injury by
shunning effeminacy.</p>

<p>Yet our traveller’s superlative constitution is severely
tested when he reaches the country of the Yakuti, a
tribe of Siberian Tartars. He crosses a mountain range,
and halts, with the attendants he has now found the
means to engage, for the night, at the foot of an elevation,
somewhat sheltered from the cold north wind.
“The first thing on my arrival,” he relates, “was to
unload the horses, loosen their saddles or pads, take the
bridles out of their mouths, and tie them to a tree in such
a manner that they could not eat. The Yakuti then with
their axes proceeded to fell timber, while I and the Cossack,
with our lopatkas or wooden spades, cleared away the
snow, which was generally a couple of feet deep. We
then spread branches of the pine tree, to fortify us from
the damp or cold earth beneath us; a good fire was now
soon made, and each bringing a leathern bag from the
baggage furnished himself with a seat. We then put
the kettle on the fire, and soon forgot the sufferings of
the day. At times the weather was so cold that we
were obliged to creep almost into the fire; and as I was
much worse off than the rest of the party for warm
clothing, I had recourse to every stratagem I could devise
to keep my blood in circulation. It was barely
possible to keep one side of the body from freezing,
while the other might be said to be roasting. Upon
the whole, I passed the night tolerably well, although I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
was obliged to get up five or six times to take a walk or
run, for the benefit of my feet. The following day, at
thirty miles, we again halted in the snow, when I made
a horse-shoe fire, which I found had the effect of
keeping every part of me alike warm, and I actually
slept well without any other covering than my clothes
thrown over me; whereas, before, I had only the consolation
of knowing that if I was in a freezing state with
one half of my body, the other was meanwhile roasting
to make amends.”</p>

<p>Captain Cochrane’s constitution had so much of the
power of adaptation to circumstances, that he was
enabled to make a meal even with the savagest tribes.
A deer had been shot, and the Yakuti began to eat it
uncooked! “Of course,” says he, “I had the most
luxurious part presented to me, being the marrow of the
fore-legs. I did not find it disagreeable, though eaten
raw and warm from life; in a frozen state I should consider
it a great delicacy. The animal was the size of a
good calf, weighing about two hundred pounds. Such
a quantity of meat may serve four or five good Yakuti
for a single meal, with whom it is ever famine or feast,
gluttony or starvation.”</p>

<p>The captain’s account of the feeding powers of the
Yakuti surpasses, indeed, anything to be found in the
narratives of travellers which are proverbial for wonder.
“At Tabalak I had a pretty good specimen,” he continues,
“of the appetite of a child, whose age could not
exceed five years. I had observed it crawling on the
floor, and scraping up with its thumb the tallow-grease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
which fell from a lighted candle, and I inquired in surprise
whether it proceeded from hunger or liking of the
fat. I was told from neither, but simply from the habit
in both Yakuti and Tungousi of eating wherever there
is food, and never permitting anything that can be
eaten to be lost. I gave the child a candle made of the
most impure tallow, a second, and a third—and all were
devoured with avidity. The steersman then gave him
several pounds of sour frozen butter; this also he immediately
consumed. Lastly, a large piece of yellow soap—all
went the same road; but as I was convinced that
the child would continue to gorge as long as it could
receive anything, I begged my companion to desist as I
had done. As to the statement of what a man can or
will eat, either as to quality or quantity, I am afraid it
would be quite incredible. In fact, there is nothing in
the way of fish or meat, from whatever animal, however
putrid or unwholesome, but they will devour with impunity;
and the quantity only varies from what they
have to what they can get. I have repeatedly seen a Yakut
or a Tungouse devour forty pounds of meat in a
day. The effects are very observable upon them, for,
from thin and meagre-looking men, they will become
perfectly pot-bellied. I have seen three of these gluttons
consume a reindeer at one meal.”</p>

<p>These doings of the Siberian Tartars, our young
readers will have rightly judged, however, are not among
the most praiseworthy or dignified of the “Triumphs of
Enterprise;” and we turn, with a sense of relief, to other
scenes of adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>The grand mountain range of the Andes, or Cordilleras,
with its rugged and barren peaks and volcanoes,
and destitution of human habitants, sometimes for scores
of miles in the traveller’s route, has afforded a striking
theme for many writers of their own adventures in South
America. Mr. Temple, a traveller in 1825, affords us
some exciting views of the perils of his journey from
Peru to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of one of these perilous days he had
to ascend and descend the highest mountain he had ever
yet crossed. After winding for more than two hours up
its rugged side, and precisely in the most terrifying spot,
the baggage-mule, which was in front, suddenly stopped.
“And well it might, poor little wretch, after scrambling
with its burden up such fatiguing flights of craggy
steps!” exclaims this benevolent-minded traveller; “the
narrowness of the path at this spot did not allow room
to approach the animal to unload and give it rest. On
one side was the solid rock, which drooped over our
heads in a half-arch; on the other, a frightful abyss, of
not less than two hundred feet perpendicular. Patience
was, indeed, requisite here, but the apprehension was,
that some traveller or courier might come in the contrary
direction, and, as the sun was setting, the consequences
could not fail of proving disastrous to either party.
At one time, I held a council to deliberate on the prudence
of freeing the passage by shooting the mule, and
letting it roll, baggage and all, to the bottom. In this
I was opposed by the postilion, though another as well
as myself was of opinion that it was the only method of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
rescuing us from our critical situation before nightfall.
I never felt so perplexed in my life. We were all useless,
helpless, and knew not what to do. After upwards
of half an hour—or, apprehension might add a few minutes
to this dubious and truly nervous pause—the mule,
of its own accord, moved on slowly for about twenty
yards, and stopped again; then proceeded, then stopped;
and thus, after two hours’ further ascent, we gradually
reached the summit. Two or three times I wished, for
safety’s sake, to alight, but actually I had not room to
do so upon the narrow edge of the tremendous precipice
on my left.”</p>

<p>He was less fortunate in his return over the mountains
of Tarija. “Cruel was the sight,” says he, “to
see us toiling up full fifteen miles continued steep to
the summit of the Cordillera, that here forms a ridge
round the south-western extremity of the province of
Tarija; but crueller by far to behold the wretched,
wretched mule, that slipped on the edge of the precipice,
and—away! exhibiting ten thousand summersaults,
round, round, round! down, down, down! nine hundred
and ninety-nine thousand fathoms deep!—certainly not
one yard less, according to the scale by which I measured
the chasm in my wonder-struck imagination,
while I stood in the stirrups straining forward over the
ears of my horse (which trembled with alarm), and
viewed the microscopic diminution of the mule, as it
revolved with accelerated motion to the bottom, carrying
with it our whole grand store of provision.”</p>

<p>Here they were obliged to leave the poor animal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
its fate, which there was no doubt would be that of
being devoured by condors. But a far more serious
accident befel Mr. Temple a few days after this. A
favourite horse that he had purchased on his journey to
Potosi got loose, and galloping off after a herd of his own
species speedily disappeared, and was never recovered.
His apostrophe to this animal is a specimen of fine
benevolent sentiment. “My horse,” said I to myself,
“my best horse, my favourite horse, my companion, my
friend, for so long a time, on journeys of so many hundred
miles, carrying me up and down mountains, along
the edge of precipices, across rivers and torrents, where
the safety of the rider so often depended solely on the
worthiness of the animal—to lose thee now in a moment
of so much need, in a manner so unexpected, and so
provokingly accidental, aggravated my loss. The constant
care I took of thee proves the value I set on thy
merits. At the end of many a wearisome journey, accommodation
and comfort for thee were invariably my
first consideration, let mine be what they might. Not
even the severity of the past night could induce me to
deprive thee of thy rug for my own gratification. And
must I now suddenly say farewell? Then farewell, my
trusty friend! A thousand dollars are in that portmanteau:
had I lost every one of them, they must, indeed,
have occasioned regret; but never could they have excited
such a feeling of sorrow as thou hast, my best,
my favourite horse—farewell!”</p>

<p>If we wished to depicture the earth as it must have
appeared to primeval travellers, Humboldt, the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
sagacious of adventurers, seems to assure us that South
America approaches nearest to such a picture. “In this
part of the new continent,” he remarks, “surrounded
by dense forests of boundless extent, we almost accustomed
ourselves to regard men as not being essential to
the order of nature. The earth is loaded with plants,
and nothing impedes their free development. An immense
layer of mould manifests the uninterrupted action
of organic powers. The crocodiles and the boas are
masters of the river; the jaguar, the pecari, the dante,
and the monkeys traverse the forest without fear and
without danger: there they dwell as in an ancient
inheritance. This aspect of animated nature, in which
man is nothing, has something in it strange and sad.
To this we reconcile ourselves with difficulty on the
ocean and amid the sands of Africa, though in these
scenes, where nothing recals to mind our fields, our woods,
and our streams, we are less astonished at the vast solitude
through which we pass. Here, in a fertile country,
adorned with eternal verdure, we seek in vain the traces
of the power of man; we seem to be transported into a
world different from that which gave us birth.”</p>

<p>Of the suffering to be encountered by adventurers in
these regions, we are assured, however, by Humboldt,
the chief source does not consist in the presence of crocodiles
or serpents, jaguars or monkeys. The dread of
these sinks into nothing when compared to the <em>plaga de
la moscas</em>—the torment of insects. “However accustomed,”
says Humboldt, “you may be to endure pain
without complaint—however lively an interest you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
take in the object of your researches—it is impossible not
to be constantly disturbed by the musquetoes, zaucudoes,
jejeus, and tempraneroes that cover the face and hands,
pierce the clothes with their long sucker in the shape of
a needle, and getting into the mouth and nostrils set
you coughing and sneezing whenever you attempt to
speak in the open air. I doubt whether there be a
country on earth where man is exposed to more cruel
torments in the rainy seasons, when the lower strata of
the air to the height of fifteen or twenty feet are filled
with venomous insects like a condensed vapour.”</p>

<p>This terrific account of the American mosquito is confirmed
by Mr. Hood, one of the companions of Captain
Franklin, in the intrepid attempt to reach the North
Pole by overland journey. “We had sometimes procured
a little rest,” he observes, “by closing the tent
and burning wood or flashing gunpowder within, the
smoke driving the musquitoes into the crannies of the
ground. But this remedy was now ineffectual, though
we employed it so perseveringly as to hazard suffocation.
They swarmed under our blankets, goring us with their
envenomed trunks and steeping our clothes in blood.
We rose at daylight in a fever, and our misery was unmitigated
during our whole stay. The food of the
mosquito is blood, which it can extract by penetrating
the hide of a buffalo; and if it is not disturbed it gorges
itself so as to swell its body into a transparent globe.
The wound does not swell, like that of the African
mosquito, but it is infinitely more painful; and when
multiplied an hundred-fold, and continued for so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
successive days, it becomes an evil of such magnitude
that cold, famine, and every other concomitant of an
inhospitable climate, must yield pre-eminence to it. It
chases the buffalo to the plains, irritating him to madness;
and the reindeer to the sea-shore, from which
they do not return till the scourge has ceased.”</p>

<p>Captain Back, whose Arctic Land Expedition has made
his name memorable, confirms these accounts. After
describing the difficulties of himself and party in dragging
their baggage and provisions, and even their canoe, up
high, steep, and rugged ridges, over swamps of thick
stunted firs, and open spaces barren and desolate, on
which “crag was piled on crag to the height of two
thousand feet from the base,” he adds these descriptive
sentences of the insect plague: “The laborious duty
which had been thus performed was rendered doubly
severe by the combined attack of myriads of sandflies
and mosquitoes, which made our faces stream with blood.
There is certainly no form of wretchedness among those
to which the chequered life of a traveller is exposed, at
once so great and so humiliating, as the torture inflicted
by these puny blood-suckers. To avoid them is impossible;
and as for defending himself, though for a
time he may go on crushing by thousands, he cannot
long maintain the unequal conflict, so that at last, subdued
by pain and fatigue, he throws himself in despair
with his face to the earth, and, half suffocated in his
blanket, groans away a few hours of sleepless rest.”</p>

<p>The swarms of sandflies, called <em>brulots</em> by the Canadians,
it appears by the following account of Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Back, are as annoying as the mosquitoes:—“As we
dived into the confined and suffocating chasms, or waded
through the close swamps, they rose in clouds, actually
darkening the air. To see or speak was equally difficult,
for they rushed at every undefended part and fixed their
poisonous fangs in an instant. Our faces streamed with
blood as if leeches had been applied, and there was a
burning and irritating pain, followed by immediate inflammation,
and producing giddiness which almost drove
us mad. Whenever we halted, which the nature of the
country compelled us to do often, the men—even the
Indians—threw themselves on their faces, and moaned
with pain and agony. My arms being less encumbered
I defended myself in some degree by waving a branch
in each hand; but, even with this and the aid of a veil
and stout leather gloves, I did not escape without severe
punishment. For the time I thought the tiny plagues
worse even than mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>The ardour which can bear a man onward through
difficulties and annoyances of this nature is admirable;
but love is united with our admiration when Capt. Back
gives the following testimony to the benevolence of Sir
John Franklin:—</p>

<p>“It was the custom of Sir John Franklin never to
kill a fly; and though teased by them beyond expression,
especially when engaged in taking observations, he would
quietly desist from his work and patiently blow the half-gorged
intruders from his hands—‘the world was wide
enough for both.’ This was jocosely remarked upon by
Akaitcho and the four or five Indians who accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
him. But the impression, it seems,” continues Captain
Back, “had sunk deep, for on Manfelly’s seeing me fill
my tent with smoke, and then throw open the front and
beat the sides all round with leafy branches to drive out
the stupified pests before I went to rest, he could not
refrain from expressing his surprise that I should be so
unlike ‘the old chief,’ who would not destroy so much as
a single mosquito.” So true it is that the real hero, he
for whom danger has no terrors, has the kindest and
gentlest nature!</p>

<p class="no-indent">He who first committed himself to the perils of the great
waters must have been peculiarly distinguished among
men for his intrepidity. Modern adventure on the wide
ocean, or in comparatively unknown seas, is not accompanied
with that uncertainty and sense of utter desolation
which must have filled the mind of early adventurers
when driven out of sight of land by the tempest; but
neither the discovery of the compass nor the many
other aids to safety possessed by modern navigators
free their enterprises from appalling dangers. The persevering
courage of travellers evermore commands our
admiration; but the voyager takes his life in his hand
from the moment that he leaves the shore. The freedom
from fear—nay, the cheerfulness and exultation he
experiences when surrounded by the waste of waters, far
away from the enjoyments of house and home; the unsubduable
resolution with which he careers over the
wave and encounters every vicissitude of season and
climate; the strength and vastness of the element itself
which is the chief scene of his daring enterprise: these
are considerations that ever interweave themselves with
our ideal of the sea-adventurer, and render him the
object of more profound and ardent admiration than the
mere traveller by land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>To ourselves, as natives of a country whose greatness
is owing to commercial enterprise and superiority in the
arts of navigation, these remarks forcibly apply. Maritime
discovery has been oftener, much oftener, undertaken
by England and Englishmen than by any other
country or people in the world. Many secondary
reasons for this might be alleged in addition to the
primary one of discovery. Such undertakings are the
means of training our sailors to hardihood and young
officers to the most difficult and dangerous situations in
which a ship can be placed. They accustom the officers
how to take care of and to preserve the health of a ship’s
company. They are the means of solid instruction in
the higher branches of nautical science, and in the use
of the various instruments which science has, of late
years especially, brought to such perfection.</p>

<p>The career of the navigator thus assumes a higher
character, being that of a pioneer of science and corroborator
of its discoveries, than the employ or profession
of any other man, however elevated the station allotted
him by society. Reflection will convince the young
reader that such men as Cook and Vancouver, Parry and
Ross, are much more deserving of triumphal monuments
than martial heroes. The dangers they encountered
were fully as great, while the tendency of their grand
enterprises was not to inflict suffering on mankind but
to enlighten it with the knowledge of distant quarters of
the globe, and to bless and enrich it by the improvement
of navigation and commerce. For these reasons, the
claim of the navigator to a high rank in our brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
chronicle of the “Triumphs of Enterprise” would boldly
assert itself, independent of the exciting nature of sea
adventures.</p>

<p>Here is an hour of danger described by the heroic
Ross, and occurring in the month of August, 1818,
during that intrepid commander’s search for the long
wished-for “North-West Passage.” “The two ships
were caught by a gale of wind among the ice, and fell
foul of each other. The ice-anchors and cables broke,
one after another, and the sterns of the two ships came
so violently into contact as to crush to pieces a boat
that could not be removed in time. Neither the masters,
the mates, nor those men who had been all their
lives in the Greenland service, had ever experienced such
imminent peril; and they declared that a common
whaler must have been crushed to atoms. Our safety
must, indeed, be attributed to the perfect and admirable
manner in which the vessels had been strengthened
when fitting for the service. But our troubles were not
yet at an end; for, as the gale increased, the ice began
to move with greater velocity, while the continued thick
fall of snow kept from our sight the further danger
that awaited us, till it became imminent. A large field
of ice was soon discovered at a small distance, bearing
fast down upon us from the west, and it thus became
necessary to saw docks for refuge, in which service all
hands were immediately employed. It was, however,
found to be too thick for our nine-feet saws, and no
progress could be made. This circumstance proved fortunate,
for it was soon after perceived that the field, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
which we were moored for this purpose, was drifting
rapidly on a reef of icebergs which lay aground. The
topsails were therefore close-reefed, in order that we
might run, as a last resource, between two bergs, or into
any creek that might be found among them; when
suddenly the field acquired a circular motion, so that
every exertion was now necessary for the purpose of
warping along the edge, that being the sole chance we
had of escaping the danger of being crushed on an
iceberg. In a few minutes we observed that part of the
field into which we had attempted to cut our docks,
come in contact with the berg, with such rapidity and
violence as to rise more than fifty feet up its precipitous
side, where it suddenly broke, the elevated part falling
back on the rest with a terrible crash, and overwhelming
with its ruins the very spot we had previously chosen
for our safety. Soon afterwards the ice appeared to us
sufficiently open for us to pass the reef of bergs, and we
once more found ourselves in a place of security.”</p>

<p>The terrors of an iceberg scene are most graphically
depicted by Ross, in the account of his second voyage
of discovery. “It is unfortunate,” says he, “that no
description can convey an idea of a scene of this nature;
and, as to pencil, it cannot represent motion or noise.
And to those who have not seen a northern ocean in
winter—who have not seen it, I should say, in a winter’s
storm—the term ice, exciting but the recollection of
what they only know at rest, in an inland lake or canal,
conveys no ideas of what it is the fate of an arctic navigator
to witness and to feel. But let them remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
that ice is stone; a floating rock in the stream, a promontory
or an island when aground, not less solid than if
it were a land of granite. Then let them imagine, if
they can, these mountains of crystal hurled through a
narrow strait by a rapid tide; meeting, as mountains in
motion would meet, with the noise of thunder, breaking
from each other’s precipices huge fragments, or rending
each other asunder, till, losing their former equilibrium,
they fall over headlong, lifting the sea around in
breakers, and whirling it in eddies; while the flatter
fields of ice forced against these masses, or against the
rocks, by the wind and the stream, rise out of the sea
till they fall back on themselves, adding to the indescribable
commotion and noise which attend these occurrences.”</p>

<p>How tremendous must be the sense of danger to the
tenants of a frail ship amidst such gigantic forces of
nature, the most inexperienced reader can form some
conception. But, overwhelming as the feeling of awe
must be with the sailor surrounded with such terrors, it
must be infinitely more tolerable than the prolonged
and indescribably irksome heart-ache he experiences
when inclosed for months in fixed ice, encompassed on
every hand with desolation. “He must be a seaman,”
says the same gallant adventurer, “to feel that the vessel
which bounds beneath him, which listens to and
obeys the smallest movement of his hand, which seems
to move but under his will, is ‘a thing of life,’ a mind
conforming to his wishes: not an inert body, the sport
of winds and waves. But what seaman could feel this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
as we did, when this creature, which used to carry us
buoyantly over the ocean, had been during an entire
year immoveable as the ice and the rocks around it,
helpless, disobedient, dead? We were weary for want
of occupation, for want of variety, for want of the
means of mental exertion, for want of thought, and (why
should I not say it?) for want of society. To-day was
as yesterday—and as was to-day, so would be to-morrow:
while, if there were no variety, no hope of better, is it
wonderful that even the visits of barbarians were welcome?
or can anything more strongly show the nature
of our pleasures, than the confession that these visits
were delightful—even as the society of London might
be amid the business of London? When the winter
has once in reality set in, our minds become made up on
the subject; like the dormouse (though we may not
sleep, which would be the most desirable condition by
far), we wrap ourselves up in a sort of furry contentment,
since better cannot be, and wait for the times to
come: it was a far other thing to be ever awake, waiting
to rise and become active, yet ever to find that all nature
was still asleep, and that we had nothing more to do
than to wish and groan, and—hope as we best might.”
How truly poetical his description of human feeling
amidst the eternal appearance of ice and snow!—“When
snow was our decks, snow was our awnings, snow our
observations, snow our larders, snow our salt; and, when
all the other uses of snow should be at last of no more
avail, our coffins and our graves were to be graves and
coffins of snow. Is this not more than enough of snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
than suffices for admiration? Is it not worse, that
during ten months in a year the ground is snow, and
ice, and ‘slush;’ that during the whole year its tormenting,
chilling, odious presence is ever before the
eye? Who more than I has admired the glaciers of the
extreme north? Who more has loved to contemplate
the icebergs sailing from the Pole before the tide and
the gale, floating along the ocean, through calm and
through storm, like castles and towers and mountains,
gorgeous in colouring, and magnificent, if often capricious,
in form? And have I, too, not sought amid the
crashing, and the splitting, and the thundering roarings
of a sea of moving mountains, for the sublime, and felt
that Nature could do no more? In all this there has
been beauty, horror, danger, everything that could excite;
they would have excited a poet even to the verge of madness.
But to see, to have seen, ice and snow—to have
felt snow and ice for ever, and nothing for ever but snow
and ice, during all the months of a year—to have seen
and felt but uninterrupted and unceasing ice and snow
during all the months of four years—this it is that has
made the sight of those most chilling and wearisome
objects an evil which is still one in recollection, as if the
remembrance would never cease.”</p>

<p>To bid farewell to his ship in these regions of deathly
solitariness must be a trial of the heart even severer
than its sense of awe amid icebergs, or wearisomeness
with the eternal snow. This fell to the lot of the brave
Ross and his crew. Fast beset where there was no
prospect of release, they commenced carrying forwards a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
certain quantity of provisions, and the boats with their
sledges, for the purpose of advancing more easily afterwards.
The labour of proceeding over ice and snow was
most severe, and the wind and snow-drift rendered it
almost intolerable. On the 21st of May, 1832 (for this
was during Sir John Ross’s <em>second</em> voyage) all the provisions
from their ship, the Victory, had been carried
forward to the several deposits, except as much as would
serve for about a month. In the process of forming
these deposits it was found that they had travelled, forwards
and backwards, three hundred and twenty-nine
miles to gain about thirty in a direct line. Preparation
was now made for their final departure, which took place
on the 29th of May.</p>

<p>“We had now,” continues the commander, “secured
everything on shore which could be of use to us in case
of our return; or which, if we could not, would prove of
use to the natives. The colours were therefore hoisted
and nailed to the mast, we drank a parting glass to our
poor ship, and having seen every man out, in the evening
I took my own adieu of the Victory, which had deserved
a better fate. It was the first vessel that I had ever
been obliged to abandon, after having served in thirty-six,
during a period of forty-two years. It was like the
last parting with an old friend; and I did not pass the
point where she ceased to be visible without stopping to
take a sketch of this melancholy desert—rendered more
melancholy by the solitary, abandoned, helpless home of
our past years, fixed in immovable ice till Time should
perform on her his usual work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>After a full month’s most fatiguing journey, they encamped
and constructed a canvass-covered house. This
they deserted, and set out once more, but, after several
weeks’ vain attempt to reach navigable water, were compelled
to return, “their labours at an end, and themselves
once more at home.” Here—of the provisions
left behind them—flour, sugar, soups, peas, vegetables,
pickles, and lemon-juice, were in abundance; but of
preserved meats there remained not more than would
suffice for their voyage in the boats during the next
season. A monotonous winter was spent in their house;
and the want of exercise, of sufficient employment, short
allowance of food, lowness of spirits produced by the unbroken
sight of the dull, melancholy, uniform waste of
snow and ice, had the effect of reducing the whole party
to a more indifferent state of health than had hitherto
been experienced.</p>

<p>“We were indeed all very weary of this miserable
home,” says Sir John Ross. “Even the storms were
without variety: there was nothing to see out of doors,
even when we could face the sky; and within it was to
look equally for variety and employment and to find
neither. If those of the least active minds dozed away
their time in the waking stupefaction which such a state
of things produces, they were the most fortunate of the
party. Those among us who had the enviable talent of
sleeping at all times, whether they were anxious or not,
fared best.”</p>

<p>At length the long-looked-for period arrived when it
was deemed necessary to abandon the house in search of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
better fortune; and on the 7th of July, being Sunday,
the last divine service was performed in their winter
habitation. The following day they bid adieu to it for
ever! and having been detained a short time at Batty
Bay, and finding the ice to separate and a lane of water
to open out, they succeeded in crossing over to the
eastern side of Prince Regent Inlet. Standing along
the southern shore of Barrow’s Strait, on the 26th of
August they discovered a sail, and, after some tantalizing
delays, they succeeded in making themselves visible to
the crew of one of her boats.</p>

<p>“She was soon alongside,” proceeds Sir John Ross,
“when the mate in command addressed us, by presuming
that we had met with some misfortune and lost our ship.
This being answered in the affirmative, I requested to
know the name of his vessel, and expressed our wish to
be taken on board. I was answered that it was the
‘Isabella of Hull, once commanded by Captain Ross;’
on which I stated that I was the identical man in question,
and my people the crew of the Victory. That the
mate who commanded this boat was as much astonished
at this information as he appeared to be I do not doubt;
while, with the usual blunderheadedness of men on such
occasions, he assured me that I had been dead two years!
I easily convinced him, however, that what ought to have
been true, according to his estimate, was a somewhat
premature conclusion, as the bear-like form of the whole
set of us might have shown him had he taken time to
consider that we were certainly not whaling gentlemen,
and that we carried tolerable evidence of our being ‘true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
men, and no impostors’ on our backs, and in our starved
and unshaven countenances. A hearty congratulation
followed, of course, in the true seaman style, and after
a few natural inquiries he added that the ‘Isabella was
commanded by Captain Humphreys,’ when he immediately
went off in his boat to communicate his information
on board, repeating that we had long been given up
as lost, not by them alone, but by all England.</p>

<p>“As we approached slowly after him to the ship, he
jumped up the side, and in a minute the rigging was
manned, while we were saluted with three cheers as we
came within cable’s length, and were not long in getting
on board of my old vessel, where we were all received by
Captain Humphreys with a hearty seaman’s welcome.</p>

<p>“Though we had not been supported by our names
and characters, we should not the less have claimed, from
charity, the attentions that we received, for never was
seen a more miserable-looking set of wretches; while,
that we were but a repulsive-looking people, none of us
could doubt. If to be poor, wretchedly poor, as far as
all our present property was concerned, was to have a
claim on charity, no one could well deserve it more;
but if to look so as to frighten away the so-called
charitable, no beggar that wanders in Ireland could have
outdone us in exciting the repugnance of those who have
not known what poverty can be. Unshaven since I know
not when, dirty, dressed in the rags of wild beasts instead
of the tatters of civilization, and starved to the very
bones, our gaunt and grim looks, when contrasted with
those of the well-dressed and well-fed men around us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
made us all feel, I believe for the first time, what we
really were as well as what we seemed to others. Poverty
is without half its mark unless it be contrasted with
wealth; and what we might have known to be true in
the past days, we had forgotten to think of till we were
thus reminded of what we truly were as well as seemed
to be.</p>

<p>“But the ludicrous soon took place of all other feelings;
in such a crowd and such confusion all serious
thought was impossible, while the new buoyancy of our
spirits made us abundantly willing to be amused by the
scene which now opened. Every man was hungry and
was to be fed, all were ragged and were to be clothed,
there was not one to whom washing was not indispensable,
nor one whom his beard did not deprive of all
English semblance. All, everything, too, was to be done
at once; it was washing, dressing, shaving, eating, all
intermingled; it was all the materials of each jumbled
together; while, in the midst of all, there were interminable
questions to be asked and answered on all sides:
the adventures of the Victory, our own escapes, the
politics of England, and the news which was now four
years old. But all subsided into peace at last. The
sick were accommodated, the seamen disposed of, and all
was done for all of us which care and kindness could
perform. Night at length brought quiet and serious
thoughts, and I trust there was not one man among us
who did not then express, where it was due, his gratitude
for that interposition which had raised us all from a
despair which none could now forget, and had brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
us from the very borders of a not distant grave to life,
and friends, and civilization.</p>

<p>“Long accustomed, however, to a cold bed on the
hard snow or the bare rock, few could sleep amid the
comfort of our new accommodations. I was myself
compelled to leave the bed which had been kindly
assigned me and take my abode in a chair for the night,
nor did it fare much better with the rest. It was for
time to reconcile us to this sudden and violent change,
to break through what had become habit, and to inure
us once more to the usages of our former days.”</p>

<p>As a curious contrast to these exciting descriptions of
danger, we will sketch in as compact a form as possible
the first voyage round the world performed by an
Englishman—namely, our illustrious countryman, Sir
Francis Drake.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth, on presenting a sword to the commander
of a secret expedition, said, “We do account
that he which striketh at thee, Drake, striketh at us.”
His fleet consisted of five ships—the Pelican, of 120 tons
burthen; the Elizabeth, a bark of 80 tons; the Swan, a
fly-boat of 50 tons; the Marygold, a barque of 30 tons,
and the Christopher, a pinnace of 15 tons, and was
ostensibly fitted out for a trading voyage to Alexandria,
though this pretence did not deceive the watchful
Spaniards. Drake, like Columbus and Cook, chose
small ships as better fitted to thread narrow and difficult
channels. The crews of his little squadron amounted to
one hundred and sixty men; an old author says that he
did not omit “provision for ornament and delight, carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
with him expert musicians, rich furniture (all the
vessels for his table, yea, many belonging to his cook-room,
being of pure silver), with divers shows of all sorts
of curious workmanship whereby the civility and magnificence
of his native country might, among all nations
whither he should come, be the more admired.”</p>

<p>Although it is likely that the intrepid resolve of crossing
the Pacific Ocean was not originally formed by
Drake, and only entered into from circumstances in
which he was afterwards placed, he is not the less entitled
to the praise so often given him for penetrating with so
small a force the channel explored by Magellan and
known by his name. The passage through the Straits
of Magellan had long been abandoned by the Spaniards,
and a superstition had arisen against adventuring into
the Pacific, as likely to prove fatal to any who are engaged
in the discovery or even in the navigation of its waters.</p>

<p>Drake was at first driven back by a violent storm; but,
unintimidated by this adverse augury, he finally set sail
from Plymouth on the 13th of December, 1577. On
Christmas-day they reached Cape Cantin, on the coast
of Barbary, and on the 27th found a safe and commodious
harbour in Mogadore. Here Drake had some
unpleasant transactions with Muley Moloc, the celebrated
king of the Moors, but sailed again on the last day of
the year. The less important places touched at in the
succeeding part of the voyage were Cape Blanco, the isles
of Mayo and San Jago, and the “Isla del Fogo,” or
Burning Island, together with “Ilba Brava,” or the
Brave Island. The equinoctial line is afterwards crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
amidst alternate calms and tempest; they are supplied
with fresh water by copious rains, and they also catch
dolphins, bonitos, and flying-fish which fell on the decks,
“where hence,” says the invaluable Hakluyt, “they
could not rise againe for want of moisture, for when
their wings are drie they cannot flie.” At length, on
the 5th of April, they had fully voyaged across the wide
Atlantic, and made the coast of Brazil in 31° 30´ south
latitude. They saw the natives raising fires on the shore,
beheld troops of wild deer, “large and mightie,” and saw
the foot-prints of men of large stature on the beach.
On the 15th of the same month they anchored in the
great River Plate, where they killed “certaine sea-wolves,
commonly called seales.” They thus secured a new supply
of fresh provisions, and shortly after of fresh water.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>On the 27th they again stood out to sea, and steered
southward. The Swan was outsailed by the rest of the
little fleet, and also the Mary, a very small Portuguese
vessel, or caunter, which they had taken in their course.
On the 12th of May, Drake anchored within view of a
headland, and the next morning went in a boat to the
shore. Here he was in some danger, for a thick fog
came on and shut him from the view of the vessels; a
gale also arose and drove them out to sea. Fires were
at length lighted, all the vessels, save the Swan and the
Mary, were again collected together. Fifty dried
ostriches, besides other fowls, are related to have been
here found deposited by the savages, and of this store
the ships’ crews took possession. Upwards of two hundred
seals were also taken and slaughtered; and while a
party was filling water-casks, killing seals, and salting
fowls for future provision, Drake himself set sail in the
Pelican, and Captain Winter in the Elizabeth, each on
different tacks, in search of the Swan and the Mary.
Drake soon found the Swan, and, to diminish the cares
and hazards of the voyage, removed all her stores and
then broke her up for firewood.</p>

<p>The place of rendezvous was named Seal Bay, and
some highly interesting accounts of interviews with the
savage native tribes during their stay here are given in
Hakluyt. On the 3rd of June they set sail once more;
on the 19th they found the missing Portuguese prize, the
Mary; and the next day the whole squadron moored in
Port San Julian, latitude 49° 30´ S.</p>

<p>A very perilous squabble took place here with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
native Patagonians. A gunner belonging to the crew
was shot through with an arrow, and died on the spot,
and Robert Winter, relative of the officer above mentioned,
was wounded, and died in consequence shortly
afterwards. The stature of these tribes has been the
subject of dispute from the time of Magellan to our own.
An old author in Hakluyt says, “These men be of no
such stature as the Spaniardes report, being but of the
height of Englishmen: for I have seene men in England
taller than I could see any of them. But peradventure
the Spaniard did not thinke that any Englishman would
have come thither so soone to have disproved them in
this and divers others of their notorious lies.” Another
author, however, makes the Patagonians seven feet and
a half in height.</p>

<p>An event occurred while the fleet lay at Port San
Julian, which has cast a deep shade of suspicion over the
character of Drake. This was the execution of Thomas
Doughty, accused of mutiny and a conspiracy to massacre
Drake and the principal officers. We leave the young
reader to investigate the matter in other works, and
proceed with our abridged narrative.</p>

<p>After breaking up the Portuguese prize and reducing
the number of ships to three, they again set sail on the
17th of August—the weather being colder than midwinter
in Britain—and on the 24th anchored thirty
leagues within the Strait of Magellan. Here Drake
changed the name of his ship, the Pelican, to the
Golden Hind, in compliment to his friend, Sir
Christopher Hatton, in whose escutcheon the golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
hind is said to have had a place. While passing through
the strait, which they computed to be 110 leagues in
length, they noted that the width varied from one league
to four; that the tide set in from each end of the strait
and met about the middle; and they also killed 3000
“of birds having no wings, but short pineons which
serve their turne in swimming.” These penguins, as
they undoubtedly were, are also described as being “fat
as an English goose.”</p>

<p>On the 6th of September, 1578, Drake and his gallant
crew sailed their ships on the great Pacific. Magellan
had passed through the strait in 1520, and but two other
voyagers had performed the passage after Magellan, and
before Drake.</p>

<p>A north-east passage was one main object contemplated
by Drake; and accordingly, on clearing the strait,
he held a north-west course, and in two days the fleet
advanced seventy leagues. A violent gale from the
north-east now drove them into 57° south latitude and
200 leagues to the west. Under bare poles they scudded
before the tempest, and observed an eclipse of the moon
on the 15th of September; “but,” says a narrator, in
Hakluyt, “neyther did the eclipticall conflict of the
moon impayre our state, nor her clearing againe amend
us a whit, but the accustomed eclipse of the sea continued
in his force, wee being darkened more than the
moone sevenfold.” After a short season of moderate
weather, another tempest separated from them the ship
Marygold, and she was never more heard of. The
Golden Hind and Elizabeth were now left to pursue the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
voyage; but on being driven back to the western
entrance of the strait, Winter, the commander of the
Elizabeth, heartily tired of the voyage, slipped away
from Drake and returned to England. He reached this
country in June, 1579, with the credit of having achieved
the navigation of the Straits of Magellan, but with the
shame of having deserted his commander.</p>

<p>The gallant Drake in the Golden Hind had stormy
weather to encounter for some time after, and was driven
so far south as to anchor in a creek at Cape Horn, and
thus became the discoverer of that southern point of the
entire continent of America.</p>

<p>The wind changing he steered northwards, and on the
25th of November, 1578, anchored near the coast of
Chili, where he had another collision with the natives
and lost two of his men. Soon afterwards they fell in
with a people of more friendly manners, and learned that
they had oversailed Valparaiso, the port of San Jago,
where a Spanish ship lay at anchor. They put back
and took the ship, called the Grand Captain of the
South, in which were 60,000 pesos of gold, besides
jewels, merchandise, and a good store of Chili wine.
Each peso was valued at eight shillings. They rejoiced
over their plunder; but in our own times such an act
would be deemed a piracy. Nine families inhabited
Valparaiso, but they fled, and the English revelled in
the pillage of wine, bread, bacon, and other luxuries to
men long accustomed to hard fare. They plundered the
church also of a silver chalice, two cruets, and an altar-cloth,
and presented them to the chaplain of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>On the 19th of January, 1579, after some period of
rest in a harbour, they pursued their voyage along the
coast, and accidentally landing at Tarapaza, they found
a Spaniard asleep on the shore with thirteen bars of
silver lying beside him. “We took the silver and left
the man,” says the relator. A little farther on a party
which was sent ashore to procure water fell in with a
Spaniard and a native boy driving eight llamas, each of
which was laden with two leathern bags containing fifty
pounds of silver, or eight hundred in all. They not only
took on board the llamas and the silver, but soon after
fell in with three small barks quite empty (the crews
being on shore), save that they found in them fifty-seven
wedges of silver, each weighing twenty pounds. They
took the silver and set the barks adrift. After some
other trifling adventures they learned that the Cacafuego,
a ship laden with gold and silver, had just sailed for
Panama, the point whence all goods were carried by the
Spaniards across the isthmus. Away they bore in search
of this ship, but were near being overtaken by a superior
force of Spaniards in two ships. Escaping, they passed
Payta, and learned that the Cacafuego had the start of
them but two days. Two other vessels were next taken,
with some silver, eighty pounds of gold, and a golden
crucifix “with goodly great emerauds set in it.” The
Cacafuego was at length overtaken and captured: the
ship contained twenty-six tons of silver, thirteen chests
of rials of plate, and eighty pounds of gold, besides
diamonds and inferior gems, the whole estimated at
360,000 pesos. The uncoined silver alone found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
vessel may be estimated at 212,000<em>l.</em>, at five shillings
an ounce.</p>

<p>It seems questionable whether, when thus richly laden,
Drake would have thought of encompassing the globe
if he could have assured himself of a safe voyage to England
by returning through the Straits of Magellan. He
knew that the Spaniards would be on the alert to recover
the treasure, and so resolved to seek a north-east passage
homeward. After remaining a short time in a safe
harbour to repair the ship, he commenced the voyage
once more. Delays were made for plunder and prizetaking
until the 26th of April, when Drake stood boldly
out to sea, and by the 3rd of June had sailed 1400
leagues on different courses without seeing land. He
had now reached 42° north latitude, and the cold was
felt severely. On the 5th, being driven by a gale, land
was seen, to the surprise of Drake, who had not calculated
that the continent stretched so far westward. The
adventurers were now coasting the western margin of
California.</p>

<p>They anchored at length in 38° 30´ north latitude, and
were soon surrounded with native Indians, who, among
other remarkable things, offered them <em>tabah</em>, or tobacco.
Drake spent thirty-six days here for completing the
repairs of his ship, took possession of the country
formally, by erecting a monument and fixing a brass plate
upon it, bearing the name, effigy, and arms of Queen
Elizabeth, and called the country New Albion. To the
port in which they had anchored he gave his own name,
and on the 23rd of July bore away direct west as possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
across the Pacific, with the intent to reach England by
India and the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>No land was seen by the gallant men on board this
little ship for sixty-eight days. On the 30th of September
they fell in with some islands in 8° north latitude,
which they termed the Isle of Thieves, from the dishonest
disposition of the natives. On the 16th of October
they reached the Philippines, and anchored at Mindanao.
On the 3rd of November the Moluccas were seen, and
they soon anchored before the chief town of Ternate,
entered into civil gossip with the natives, and were visited
by the king, “a true gentleman Pagan.” Among the
presents received from this royal person were fowls, rice,
sugar, cloves, figs, and “a sort of meale which they call
<em>sagu</em>, made of the tops of certaine trees, tasting in the
mouth like soure curds, but melteth like sugar, whereof
they make certaine cakes, which may be kept the space
of ten yeeres and yet then good to be eaten.” Brilliant
offers were made by the Sultan of Ternate; but Drake
was shy of them, and on the 9th of November, having
taken in a large quantity of cloves, the Golden Hind left
the Moluccas.</p>

<p>On the 14th they anchored near the eastern part of
Celebes, and finding the land uninhabited and abundant
in forests, they determined there fully to repair the ship
for her voyage home. “Throughout the groves,” say
the old writers in Purchas and Hakluyt, “there flickered
innumerable bats ‘as bigge as large hennes.’ There
were also multitudes of ‘fiery wormes flying in the ayre,’
no larger than the common fly in England, which skimming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
up and down between woods and bushes, made
“such a shew and light as if every twigge or tree had
bene a burning candle.” They likewise saw great numbers
of land-crabs, or cray-fish, “of exceeding bignesse,
one whereof was sufficient for foure hungry stomackes at
a dinner, being also very good and restoring meat,
whereof wee had experience; and they digge themselves
holes in the earth like conies.”</p>

<p>On the 12th of December they again set sail; but
now came their great peril. After being entangled in
shoals among the Spice Islands for some days, in the
night of the 9th of January, 1580, the Golden Hind
struck on a rock. No leak appeared; but the ship was
immovable. The ebb tide left her in but six feet
water, while, so deeply was she laden, that it required
thirteen feet of water to float her. Eight guns, three
tons of cloves, and a quantity of meal were thrown overboard,
but this did not relieve the ship. “We stucke
fast,” says the narrator in Hakluyt, “from eight of the
clocke at night til foure of the clocke in the afternoone
the next day, being indeede out of all hope to escape the
danger; but our generall, as he had alwayes hitherto
shewed himself couragious, and of a good confidence in
the mercie and protection of God, so now he continued
in the same; and lest he should seeme to perish wilfully,
both hee and wee did our best indevour to save ourselves,
which it pleased God so to blesse, that in the ende we
cleared ourselves most happily of the danger.”</p>

<p>Their ship in deep water once more, they reached the
Isle of Barateve on the 8th of February, and were kindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
and handsomely treated by the inhabitants. Java was
reached on the 12th of March, and here again they were
generously received. On the 26th they left Java, and
did not again see land till they passed the Cape of Good
Hope, on the 15th of June. The Portuguese being
acquaintances, Drake did not wish just then to meet; he
did not land at the Cape, but steered away north, and
on the 22nd of July arrived at Sierra Leone. Finally,
on the 26th of September, 1580, after an absence of two
years and ten months, he came to anchor in the harbour
of Plymouth.</p>

<p>The riches he had brought home, the daring bravery
he had displayed, the perils undergone, the marvels told
of the strange countries visited, made Drake the idol of
the whole English people. On the 4th of April, 1581,
Queen Elizabeth went in state to dine on board the
Golden Hind, then lying at Deptford. After the banquet
she knighted the gallant circumnavigator, and also gave
orders that his vessel should be preserved as a monument
of the glory of the nation and of the illustrious voyager.</p>

<p class="no-indent">One path of Enterprise belongs distinctly to modern
adventurers—the search after interesting remains of
antiquity, and investigation of their present actual condition.
Such enterprises of discovery have often their
source in a love of Art, which can only exist in the most
cultivated minds. In other instances they arise from a
laudable desire to verify ancient history, and thus serve
the highly important purpose of confirming that branch
of human knowledge which has hitherto depended simply
on the testimony of written tradition.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest contributor to certain knowledge
in this department of enterprise and discovery was the
celebrated Belzoni, though our acquaintance with the
time-honoured and mysterious monuments of Egypt has
been enlarged by many other travellers. Greece has
also had her distinguished list of antiquarian explorers;
and the glowing lands of the East, so famous in sacred
and profane story, have been visited by numerous travellers,
each and all ardent to survey and report the present
condition of the diversified monuments of human skill
and strength existing in the primeval countries of our
race.</p>

<p>Every youthful visitor to the British Museum will be
interested with the beautiful black granite statue so well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
known as “the young Memnon.” Near the left foot of
this gigantic sitting figure will be found the name of
Belzoni, cut by his own hand. Burckhardt and Salt
were the enterprising and disinterested persons who paid
the expenses of conveying this massive piece of ancient
sculpture to Alexandria: Belzoni and his assistants
undertook the immense labour.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">The Ruins of Luxor.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was amidst the ruins of Thebes, old Homer’s “city
of the hundred gates,” that this far-famed statue of an
old Egyptian king had long lain. His wonder at entering
this ruined metropolis is thus described by Belzoni:
“We saw for the first time the ruins of great Thebes,
and landed at Luxor. Here I beg the reader to observe
that but very imperfect ideas can be formed of the extensive
ruins of Thebes, even from the accounts of the most
skilful and accurate travellers. It is absolutely impossible
to imagine the scene displayed without seeing it.
The most sublime ideas that can be formed from the
most magnificent specimens of our present architecture
would give a very incorrect picture of these ruins; for
such is the difference, not only in magnitude, but in
form, proportion, and construction, that even the pencil
can convey but a faint idea of the whole. It appeared
to me like entering a city of giants, who, after a long
conflict, were all destroyed, leaving the ruins of their
various temples as the only proof of their former existence.
The temple of Luxor presents to the traveller at
once one of the most splendid groups of Egyptian
grandeur. The extensive propylæon, with the two
obelisks, and colossal statues in the front; the thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
groups of enormous columns; the variety of apartments
and the sanctuary it contains; the beautiful ornaments
which adorn every part of the walls and columns, cause
in the astonished traveller an oblivion of all that he has
seen before. If his attention be attracted to the north
side of Thebes by the towering remains that project a
great height above the wood of palm trees, he will gradually
enter that forest-like assemblage of ruins of temples,
columns, obelisks, colossi, sphynxes, portals, and an endless
number of other astonishing objects, that will convince
him at once of the impossibility of a description.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
On the west side of the Nile, still the traveller finds
himself among wonders. The temples of Gournou,
Memnonium, and Medinet Aboo, attest the extent of
the great city on this side. The unrivalled colossal
figures in the plain of Thebes, the number of tombs
excavated in the rocks, those in the great valley of the
kings, with their paintings, sculptures, mummies, sarcophagi,
figures, &amp;c., are all objects worthy of the admiration
of the traveller, who will not fail to wonder how a
nation which was once so great as to erect these stupendous
edifices could so far fall into oblivion that even their
language and writing are totally unknown to us.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Bust of Memnon.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The bust of Memnon, the immediate object of Belzoni’s
research, soon caught his eye. It was lying with its face
upwards, and “apparently smiling on me,” says Belzoni,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
“at the thought of being taken to England.” Among
a semi-barbarous people like the Arabs the discoverer
had a thousand difficulties to overcome before he could
succeed in moving this bust of ten or twelve tons weight
one inch from its bed of sand. The chiefs eyed him with
jealousy, and conceived, as usual, that he came in quest
of hidden treasures; and the Fellahs were with difficulty
set to work, having made up their minds that it was a
hopeless task. When these simple people saw it first
move they all set up a loud shout, declaring it was not
their exertions but the power of the devil that had
effected it. The enormous mass was put in motion by
a few poles and palm-leaf ropes, all the means which they
could command, and which nothing but the ingenuity
of Belzoni could have made efficient. But these materials,
poor as they were, created not half the difficulty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
and delay occasioned by the intrigues of the Cachefs and
Kaimakans, all of whom were desirous of extorting as
much money as they possibly could, and of obstructing
the progress of the work, as the surest means of effecting
their purpose. Even the labourers, on finding that
money was given to them for removing a mere mass of
stone, took it into their heads that it must be filled with
gold, and agreed that so precious an article ought not to
be taken out of the country. Belzoni succeeded, however,
in allaying these ridiculous imaginings, and eighteen
days after the commencement of the operation the colossal
bust reached the banks of the Nile. One day was consumed
in embarking it; and after a voyage of hazard
among the cataracts of the Nile, the illustrious traveller
reached Cairo with his prize. From thence he conveyed
it to Alexandria, and lodged it in the Pasha’s magazine;
he then returned to Cairo, and accompanied by Mr.
Beechy, immediately proceeded up the Nile, with the
determination, if possible, to accomplish the opening of
the great temple of Ipsambul, a labour he had commenced
but a short time before.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_218fp" style="max-width: 47.875em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Belzoni Removing the Bust of Memnon.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This grand and gigantic relic of antiquity was discovered
and brought into notice by the lamented Burckhardt,
but when Belzoni first approached it, the accumulation
of sand was such “that it appeared an impossibility
ever to reach the door.” The exact spot where
he had fixed the entrance to be was determined in his
own mind from observing the head of a hawk, of such
a monstrous size that, with the body, it could not be
less than twenty feet high. This bird he concluded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
be over the doorway; and as below the figure there is
generally a vacant space, followed by a frieze and cornice,
he calculated the upper part of the doorway to be
about thirty-five feet below the summit of the sand.</p>

<p>Having succeeded in procuring for hire, from one of
the cachefs, as many labourers as he could afford to employ,
Belzoni set about clearing away the sand from the
front of the temple. The only condition made with the
cachef was, that all the gold and jewels found in it
should belong to him, as chief of the country, and that
Belzoni should have all the stones. At the end of four
or five days his funds were entirely exhausted; he therefore,
after obtaining a promise from the chief that no
one should molest the work in his absence, resumed his
search for other antiquities; and, after conveying the
Memnon to Alexandria, and being joined by Mr.
Beechy at Cairo, met, at Philæ, with Captains Irby and
Mangles of the British Navy, and was joined also by
them.</p>

<p>Having conciliated the cachefs by suitable presents,
they agreed to give the workmen, who were eighty in
number, three hundred piastres for removing the sand
as low down as the entrance. At first they seemed to
set about the task like men who were determined to
finish the job; but, at the end of the third day, they all
grew tired, and, “under the pretext that the Rhamadan
was to commence on the next day, they left us,” says
Belzoni, “with the temple, the sand, and the treasure,
and contented themselves with keeping the three hundred
piastres.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>The travellers were now convinced that, if the temple
was to be opened at all, it must be by their own exertions;
and, accordingly assisted by the crew of the
boat, they set to work, and, by dint of perseverance and
hard labour for about eighteen days, they arrived at the
doorway of that temple, which had, in all probability,
been covered with sand two thousand years, and which
proved to be the finest and most extensive in Nubia.
Belzoni thus describes the exterior of the temple of Ipsambul.</p>

<p>“The outside of this temple is magnificent. It is a
hundred and seventeen feet wide, and eighty-six feet
high: the height from the top of the cornice to the top
of the door being sixty-six feet six inches, and the
height of the door twenty feet. There are four enormous
sitting colossi, the largest in Egypt or Nubia,
except the great sphinx at the pyramids, to which they
approach in the proportion of nearly two thirds. From
the shoulder to the elbow they measure fifteen feet six
inches; the ears three feet six inches; the face seven
feet; the beard five feet six inches; across the shoulders
twenty-five feet four inches; their height is about fifty-one
feet, not including the caps, which are about fourteen
feet.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">One of the Enormous Sitting Colossi.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“There are only two of these colossi in sight: one is
still buried under the sand, and the other, which is near
the door, is half fallen down, and buried also. On the
top of the door is a colossal figure of Osiris, twenty feet
high, with two colossal hieroglyphic figures, one on each
side, looking towards it. On the top of the temple is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
cornice with hieroglyphics, a torus and frieze under it.
The cornice is six feet wide, the frieze is four feet.
Above the cornice is a row of sitting monkeys eight feet
high, and six feet wide across the shoulders. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
twenty-one in number. This temple was nearly two-thirds
buried under the sand, of which we removed
thirty-one feet before we came to the upper part of the
door. It must have had a very fine landing-place, which
is now totally buried under the sand. It is the last and
largest temple excavated in the solid rock in Nubia or
Egypt, except the new tomb in Beban el Molook.</p>

<p>“The heat on first entering the temple was so great
that they could scarcely bear it, and the perspiration
from their hands was so copious as to render the paper,
by its dripping, unfit for use. On the first opening that
was made by the removal of the sand, the only living
object that presented itself was a toad of prodigious size.
Halls and chambers, supported by magnificent columns
and adorned with beautiful intaglios, paintings, and colossal
figures, the walls being covered partly with hieroglyphics,
and partly with exhibitions of battles, storming
of castles, triumphs over the Ethiopians, sacrifices, &amp;c.—made
up the striking interior.”</p>

<p>Nothing but the most extraordinary degree of enthusiasm
could have supported Belzoni in the numerous
descents which he made into the mummy pits of Egypt,
and through the long narrow subterraneous passages,
particularly inconvenient for a man of his size—for he
was six feet and a half in height, and muscular in proportion.</p>

<p>“Of some of these tombs,” says he, “many persons
could not withstand the suffocating air, which often
causes fainting. A vast quantity of dust arises, so fine
that it enters the throat and nostrils, and chokes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
nose and mouth to such a degree that it requires great
power of lungs to resist it and the strong effluvia of the
mummies. This is not all; the entry or passage where
the bodies are is roughly cut in the rocks, and the falling
of the sand from the upper part or ceiling of the passage
causes it to be nearly filled up. In some places there is
not more than the vacancy of a foot left, which you
must contrive to pass through in a creeping posture like
a snail, on pointed and keen stones that cut like glass.
After getting through these passages, some of them two
or three hundred yards long, you generally find a more
commodious place, perhaps high enough to sit. But
what a place of rest! surrounded by bodies, by heaps of
mummies in all directions, which, previous to my being
accustomed to the sight, impressed me with horror. The
blackness of the wall, the faint light given by the candles
or torches for want of air, the different objects that surrounded
me seeming to converse with each other, and
the Arabs with the candles or torches in their hands,
naked and covered with dust, themselves resembling
living mummies, absolutely formed a scene that cannot
be described. In such a situation I found myself several
times, and often returned exhausted and fainting, till at
last I became inured to it and indifferent to what I
suffered, except from the dust, which never failed to
choke my throat and nose; and though, fortunately, I
am destitute of the sense of smelling, I could taste that
the mummies were rather unpleasant to swallow. After
the exertion of entering into such a place, through a
passage of fifty, a hundred, three hundred, or perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
six hundred yards, nearly overcome, I sought a resting-place,
found one, and contrived to sit; but when my
weight bore on the body of an Egyptian, it crushed it
like a band-box. I naturally had recourse to my hands
to sustain my weight, but they found no better support,
so that I sunk altogether among the broken mummies,
with a crash of bones, rags, and wooden cases, which
raised such a dust as kept me motionless for a quarter of
an hour waiting till it subsided again. I could not
remove from the place, however, without increasing it,
and every step I took I crushed a mummy in some part
or other.</p>

<p>“Once I was conducted from such a place to another
resembling it, through a passage of about twenty feet in
length, and no wider than that a body could be forced
through. It was choked with mummies, and I could
not pass without putting my face in contact with that of
some decayed Egyptian, but as the passage inclined
downwards my own weight helped me on; however, I
could not avoid being covered with bones, legs, arms, and
heads rolling from above. Thus I proceeded from one
cave to another, all full of mummies piled up in various
ways, some standing, some lying, and some on their
heads. The purpose of my researches was to rob the
Egyptians of their papyri, of which I found a few hidden
in their breasts, under their arms, in the space above the
knees, or on the legs, and covered by the numerous folds
of cloth that envelope the mummy. The people of
Gournou, who make a trade of antiquities of this sort,
are very jealous of strangers, and keep them as secret as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
possible, deceiving travellers by pretending that they
have arrived at the end of the pits when they are scarcely
at the entrance. I could never prevail on them to conduct
me into these places till this my second voyage,
when I succeeded in obtaining admission into any cave
where mummies were to be seen.”</p>

<p>M. Drovetti, the French consul, had discovered a
sarcophagus in a cavern of the mountains of Gournou,
but had endeavoured in vain to get it out; he therefore
acquainted Belzoni that he would present him with it.
This gave occasion to an adventure which possesses much
of the interest of romance in the recital. Mr. Belzoni
entered the cavern with two Arabs and an interpreter.
He thus describes the enterprise:—</p>

<p>“Previous to our entering the cave we took off the
greater part of our clothes, and, each having a candle,
advanced through a cavity in the rock, which extended
a considerable length in the mountain, sometimes pretty
high, sometimes very narrow, and without any regularity.
In some passages we were obliged to creep on the ground,
like crocodiles. I perceived that we were at a great
distance from the entrance, and the way was so intricate
that I depended entirely on the two Arabs to conduct us
out again. At length we arrived at a large space into
which many other holes or cavities opened; and after
some examination by the two Arabs, we entered one of
these, which was very narrow, and continued downward
for a long way, through a craggy passage, till we came
where two other apertures led to the interior in a horizontal
direction. One of the Arabs then said, ‘This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
the place.’ I could not conceive how so large a sarcophagus
as had been described to me could have been
taken through the aperture which the Arab now pointed
out. I had no doubt but these recesses were burial-places,
as we continually walked over skulls and other
bones; but the sarcophagus could never have entered
this recess, for it was so narrow that on my attempt to
penetrate it I could not pass.</p>

<p>“One of the Arabs however succeeded, as did my interpreter;
and it was agreed that I and the other Arab
should wait till they returned. They proceeded evidently
to a great distance, for the light disappeared, and only a
murmuring sound from their voices could be distinguished
as they went on. After a few moments I heard
a loud noise, and the interpreter distinctly crying, ‘O,
my God, I am lost!’ After which, a profound silence
ensued. I asked my Arab whether he had ever been in
that place? He replied, ‘Never.’ I could not conceive
what could have happened, and thought the best plan
was to return, to procure help from the other Arabs.
Accordingly, I told my man to show me the way out
again; but, staring at me like an idiot, he said he did
not know the road. I called repeatedly to the interpreter,
but received no answer. I watched a long time,
but no one returned; and my situation was no very
pleasant one. I naturally returned, through the passages
by which we had come; and, after some time, I
succeeded in reaching the place where, as I mentioned,
were many cavities. It was a complete labyrinth, as all
these places bore a great resemblance to the one which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
we first entered. At last, seeing one which appeared to
be the right, we proceeded through it a long way; but,
by this time, our candles had diminished considerably,
and I feared that if we did not get out soon, we should
have to remain in the dark. Meantime, it would have
been dangerous to put one out to save the other, lest
that which was left should, by some accident, be extinguished.
At this time we were considerably advanced
towards the outside, as we thought; but, to our sorrow,
we found the end of that cavity without any outlet.</p>

<p>“Convinced that we were mistaken in our conjecture,
we quickly returned towards the place of the various
entries, which we strove to regain. But we were then
as perplexed as ever, and were both exhausted from the
ascents and descents, which we had been obliged to go
over. The Arab seated himself, but every moment of
delay was dangerous. The only expedient was to put a
mark at the place out of which we had just come, and
then examine the cavities in succession, by putting also
a mark at their entrance, so as to know where we had
been. Unfortunately our candles would not last through
the whole: however, we began our operations.</p>

<p>“On the second attempt, when passing before a small
aperture, I thought I heard the sound of something like
the roaring of the sea at a distance. In consequence, I
entered this cavity; and, as we advanced, the noise increased,
till I could distinctly hear a number of voices
all at one time. At last, thank God, we walked out;
and to my no small surprise, the first person I saw was
my interpreter. How he came to be there I could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
conjecture. He told me that, in proceeding with the
Arab along the passage below, they came to a pit, which
they did not see; that the Arab fell into it, and in falling
put out both candles. It was then that he cried out, ‘I
am lost!’ as he thought he also should have fallen into
the pit. But on raising his head, he saw, at a great
distance, a glimpse of daylight, towards which he advanced,
and thus arrived at a small aperture. He then
scraped away some loose sand and stones, to widen the
place where he came out, and went to give the alarm to
the Arabs, who were at the other entrance. Being all
concerned for the man who fell to the bottom of the
pit, it was their noise that I heard in the cave. The
place by which my interpreter got out was instantly
widened: and, in the confusion, the Arabs did not regard
letting me see that they were acquainted with that
entrance, and that it had lately been shut up. I was
not long in detecting their scheme. The Arabs had intended
to show me the sarcophagus, without letting me
see the way by which it might be taken out, and then
to stipulate a price for the secret. It was with this view
they took me such a way round about.”</p>

<p>Of all the discoveries of Belzoni, the most magnificent
was that of a new tomb in the Beban el Molook, or
Vale of the Tombs of Kings. “I may call this,” says
the traveller, “a fortunate day, one of the best perhaps
of my life: from the pleasure it afforded me of presenting
to the world a new and perfect monument of Egyptian
antiquity, which can be recorded as superior to any
other in point of grandeur, style, and preservation,—appearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
as if just finished on the day we entered it;
and what I found in it,” he adds, “will show its great
superiority to all others.” Certain indications had convinced
him of the existence of a large and unopened
sepulchre. Impressed with this idea, he caused the
earth to be dug away to the depth of eighteen feet,
when the entrance made its appearance. The passage,
however, was choked up with large stones, which were
with difficulty removed. A long corridor, with a painted
ceiling, led to a staircase twenty-three feet long, and
nearly nine feet wide. At the bottom was a door, twelve
feet high; it opened into a second corridor of the same
width, thirty-seven feet long, the sides and ceiling finely
sculptured and painted. “The more I saw,” he says,
“the more I was eager to see.” His progress, however,
was interrupted at the end of this second corridor by a
pit thirty feet deep and twelve wide. Beyond this was
perceived a small aperture of about two feet square in
the wall, out of which hung a rope reaching probably to
the bottom of the well; another rope fastened to a beam
of wood stretching across the passage, on this side also,
hung into the well. One of these ropes was unquestionably
for the purpose of descending on one side of the
well, and the other for that of ascending on the opposite
side. Both the wood and the rope crumbled to dust on
being touched.</p>

<p>By means of two beams, Belzoni contrived to cross
this pit or well, and to force a larger opening in the
wall, beyond which was discovered a third corridor of
the same dimensions as the two former. Those parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
the wood and rope which were on the further side of
this wall did not fall to dust, but were in a tolerably
good state of preservation, owing, as he supposed, to the
dryness of the air in these more distant apartments.
The pit, he thought, was intended as a sort of reservoir
to receive the wet which might drain through the ground
between it and the external entrance.</p>

<p>“The sepulchre was now found to open into a number
of chambers of different dimensions, with corridors and
staircases. Of the chambers, the first was a beautiful
hall, twenty-seven feet six inches by twenty-five feet ten
inches, in which were four pillars, each three feet square.
At the end of this room I call the Entrance-hall,” says
the famous discoverer, “is a large door, from which
three steps lead down into a chamber with two pillars.
This is twenty-eight feet two inches by twenty-five feet
six inches. The pillars are three feet ten inches square.
I gave it the name of the Drawing-room; for it is covered
with figures, which, though only outlined, are so fine
and perfect, that you would think they had been drawn
only the day before. Returning into the Entrance-hall,
we saw on the left of the aperture a large staircase,
which descended into a corridor. It is thirteen feet
four inches long, seven and a half wide, and has eighteen
steps. At the bottom we entered a beautiful corridor,
thirty-six feet six inches by six feet eleven inches. We
perceived that the paintings became more perfect as we
advanced farther into the interior. They retained their
gloss, or a kind of varnish over the colours, which had a
beautiful effect. The figures are painted on a white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
ground. At the end of this corridor we descended ten
steps, which I call the small stairs, into another, seventeen
feet two inches by ten feet five inches. From this
we entered a small chamber, twenty feet four inches by
thirteen feet eight inches, to which I gave the name of
the Room of Beauties; for it is adorned with the most
beautiful figures in basso relievo, like all the rest, and
painted. When standing in the centre of this chamber,
the traveller is surrounded by an assembly of Egyptian
gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>“Proceeding further, we entered a large hall, twenty-seven
feet nine inches by twenty-six feet ten inches. In
this hall are two rows of square pillars, three on each
side of the entrance, forming a line with the corridors.
At each side of this hall is a small chamber. This hall
I termed the Hall of Pillars: the chamber on the
right Isis’ Room, as in it a large cow is painted: that
on the left, the Room of Mysteries, from the mysterious
figures it exhibits. At the end of this hall we
entered a large saloon with an arched roof or ceiling,
which is separated from the Hall of Pillars only by a
step, so that the two may be reckoned one.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_233" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_233.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Temple of Isis.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“The saloon is thirty-one feet ten inches by twenty-seven
feet. On the right of the saloon is a small chamber
without anything in it, roughly cut, as if unfinished,
and without painting: on the left we entered a chamber
with two square pillars, twenty-five feet eight inches by
twenty-two feet ten inches. This I called the Sideboard
Room, as it has a projection of three feet in a
form of a sideboard all round, which was perhaps intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
to contain the articles necessary for the funeral
ceremony. The pillars are three feet four inches square,
and the whole beautifully painted as the rest. At the
same end of the room, and facing the Hall of Pillars,
we entered by a large door into another chamber with
four pillars, one of which is fallen down. This chamber
is forty-three feet four inches by seventeen feet six
inches; the pillars three feet seven inches square. It
is covered with white plaster, where the rock did not
cut smoothly, but there is no painting on it. I named
it the Bull’s, or Apis’ Room, as we found the carcase
of a bull in it, embalmed with asphaltum; and also,
scattered in various places, an immense quantity of
small wooden figures of mummies, six or eight inches
long, and covered with asphaltum to preserve them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
There were some other figures of fine earth baked, coloured
blue, and strongly varnished. On each side of
the two little rooms were wooden statues standing erect,
four feet high, with a circular hollow inside, as if to
contain a roll of papyrus, which I have no doubt they
did. We found likewise fragments of other statues of
wood and of composition.</p>

<p>“But the description of what we found in the centre
of the saloon, and which I have reserved till this place,
merits the most particular attention, not having its
equal in the world, and being such as we had no idea
could exist. It is a sarcophagus of the finest oriental
alabaster, nine feet five inches long, and three feet seven
inches wide. Its thickness is only two inches; and it
is transparent when a light is placed inside of it. It is
minutely sculptured within and without with several
hundred figures, which do not exceed two inches in
height, and represent, as I suppose, the whole of the
funeral procession and ceremonies relating to the deceased,
united with several emblems. I cannot give an
adequate idea of this beautiful and invaluable piece of
antiquity, and can only say that nothing has been
brought into Europe from Egypt that can be compared
with it. The cover was not there; it had been taken
out, and broken into several pieces, which we found in
digging before the first entrance. The sarcophagus was
over a staircase in the centre of the saloon, which communicated
in a subterraneous passage, leading downwards,
three hundred feet in length. At the end of this
passage we found a great quantity of bats’ dung, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
choked it up, so that we could go no further without
digging. It was nearly filled up too by the falling in of
the upper part.”</p>

<p>This sarcophagus is now to be seen in Sir John
Soane’s Museum, Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The sight of
it will richly repay the visitor. Copies of the figures on
the walls of the tomb are to be seen in the Egyptian
rooms of the British Museum, and form not the least
striking of its vast collection of curiosities.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most arduous of Belzoni’s enterprises
was the opening of the second pyramid of Ghiza, known
by the name of Cephrenes, as the largest pyramid is
known by the name of Cheops. Herodotus, the ancient
Greek historian, was informed that this pyramid had no
subterranean chambers, and his information being found
in latter ages to be generally correct, may be supposed
to have operated in preventing that curiosity which
prompted the opening of the great pyramid of Cheops
by Shaw. Belzoni, however, perceived certain indications
of sufficient weight to induce him to make the
attempt.</p>

<p>“The opening of this pyramid,” says Mr. Salt, the
English consul-general, “had long been considered an
object of so hopeless a nature that it is difficult to conceive
how any person could be found sanguine enough
to make the attempt; and even after the discovery, with
great labour, of the forced entrance, it required great
perseverance in Belzoni, and confidence in his own views,
to induce him to continue the operation, when it became
evident that the extensive labours of his predecessors in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
the enterprise had completely failed. The direct manner
in which he dug down upon the door affords the
most incontestable proof that chance had nothing to do
with the discovery itself, of which Belzoni has given a
very clear description.”</p>

<p>“On my return to Cairo,” says he, “I again went to
visit the celebrated pyramids of Ghiza; and on viewing
that of Cephrenes I could not help reflecting how many
travellers of different nations, who had visited this spot,
contented themselves with looking at the outside of the
pyramid, and went away without inquiring whether any
and what chambers exist within it; satisfied, perhaps,
with the report of the Egyptian priests, ‘that the pyramid
of Cheops only contained chambers in its interior.’
I then began to consider the possibility of opening this
pyramid. The attempt was, perhaps, presumptuous;
and the risk of undertaking such an immense work
without success deterred me in some degree from the
enterprise. I am not certain whether love for antiquity,
an ardent curiosity, or ambition, spurred me on most in
spite of every obstacle, but I determined at length to
commence the operation.</p>

<p>“I set out from Cairo on the 6th of February, 1818,
under pretence of going in quest of some antiquities at
a village not far off, in order that I might not be disturbed
in my work by the people of Cairo. I then repaired
to the Kaiya Bey, and asked permission to work
at the pyramid of Ghiza, in search of antiquities. He
made no objection, but said that he wished to know if
there was any ground about the pyramid fit for tillage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
I informed him that it was all stones, and at a considerable
distance from any tilled ground. He nevertheless
persisted in inquiring of the cachef of the province, if
there was any good ground near the pyramids; and
after receiving the necessary information, granted my
request.</p>

<p>“Having thus acquired permission I began my labours
on the 10th of February, at a point on the north side, in
a vertical section at right angles to that side of the base.
I saw many reasons against my beginning there, but
certain indications told me that there was an entrance at
that spot. I employed sixty labouring men, and began
to cut through the mass of stones and cement which had
fallen from the upper part of the pyramid; but it was
so hard joined together that the men spoiled several
of their hatchets in the operation. The stones which
had fallen down along with the cement had formed themselves
into one solid and almost impenetrable mass. I
succeeded, however, in making an opening of fifteen feet
wide, and continued working downwards in uncovering
the face of the pyramid. This work took up several
days, without the least prospect of meeting with anything
interesting. Meantime I began to fear that some of the
Europeans residing at Cairo might pay a visit to the
pyramids, which they do very often, and thus discover
my retreat and interrupt my proceedings.</p>

<p>“On the 17th of the same month we had made a
considerable advance downwards, when an Arab workman
called out, making a great noise, and saying that he
had found the entrance. He had discovered a hole in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
the pyramid into which he could just thrust his arm and
a djerid of six feet long. Towards the evening we discovered
a larger aperture, about three feet square, which
had been closed in irregularly by a hewn stone. This
stone I caused to be removed, and then came to an
opening larger than the preceding, but filled up with
loose stones and sand. This satisfied me that it was
not the real but a forced passage, which I found to lead
inwards and towards the south. The next day we succeeded
in entering fifteen feet from the outside, when we
reached a place where the sand and stones began to fall
from above. I caused the rubbish to be taken out, but
it still continued to fall in great quantities. At last,
after some days’ labour, I discovered an upper forced
entrance, communicating with the outside from above,
and which had evidently been cut by some one who was
in search of the true passage. Having cleared this
passage I perceived another opening below, which apparently
ran towards the centre of the pyramid.</p>

<p>“In a few hours I was able to enter this passage,
which runs horizontally towards the centre of the
pyramid, nearly all choked up with stones and sand.
These obstructions I caused to be taken out, and at halfway
from the entrance I found a descent, which also had
been forced, and which ended at the distance of forty
feet. I afterwards continued the work in the horizontal
passage above, in hopes that it might lead to the centre;
but I was disappointed, and at last was convinced that
it ended there, and that to attempt to advance that way
would only incur the risk of sacrificing some of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
workmen, as it was really astonishing to see how the
stones hung suspended over their heads, resting perhaps
by a single point; indeed, one of these stones fell, and
had nearly killed one of the men. I therefore retired from
the forced passage with great regret and disappointment.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the discouragements I met with I
recommenced my researches on the following day, depending
upon my indications. I directed the ground to
be cleared away to the eastward of the false entrance;
the stones, encrusted and bound together with cement,
were equally hard as the former, and we had as many
large stones to remove as before. By this time my
retreat had been discovered, which occasioned me many
interruptions from visitors.</p>

<p>“On February 28, we discovered a block of granite
in an inclined direction towards the centre of the pyramid,
and I perceived that the inclination was the same as that
of the passage of the first pyramid, or that of Cheops;
consequently I began to hope that I was near the true
entrance. On the 1st of March we observed three large
blocks of stone one upon the other, all inclined towards
the centre; these large stones we had to remove as well
as others much larger, as we advanced, which considerably
retarded our approach to the desired spot. I perceived,
however, that I was near the true entrance, and, in fact,
the next day about noon, on the 2nd of March, was the
epoch at which the grand pyramid of Cephrenes was at
last opened, after being closed up so many centuries,
that it remained an uncertainty whether any interior
chambers did or did not exist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Belzoni then gives a detailed description of the passages
leading to the great chamber of the pyramid. “On
entering the great chamber,” he continues, “I found it
to be forty-six feet three inches long, sixteen feet three
inches wide, and twenty-three feet six inches high, for
the most part cut out of the solid rock (for this chamber
was at the bottom of the pyramid) except that part of
the roof towards the western end. In the midst we observed
a sarcophagus of granite partly buried in the
ground to the level of the floor, eight feet long, three
feet six inches wide, and two feet three inches deep inside,
surrounded by large blocks of granite, being placed apparently
to guard it from being taken away, which could
not be effected without great labour. The lid of it had
been opened; I found in it only a few bones of a human
skeleton, which merit preservation as curious relics, they
being in all probability those of Cephrenes, the reported
builder of the pyramid.”</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to inform the young reader
that Belzoni, being unversed in osteology, was mistaken
here, and that these bones, when examined by scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
men in London, were found to be those of a cow; thus
giving foundation for the theory that the bodies of sacred
animals, the representatives of the Egyptian gods, were
interred with extraordinary honours.</p>

<p>To narrate all the enterprises of Belzoni would occupy
volumes. Let us allude but to one more. He uncovered
the front of the great Sphynx—that gigantic
monument which has been synonymous with “Mystery”
from the remotest ages of history. Numerous pieces of
antiquity were as unexpectedly as extraordinarily developed
by this enterprise—pieces which, for many
centuries, had not been exposed to human eyes. Among
other things, a beautiful temple, cut out of one piece of
granite, yet of considerable dimensions, was discovered
between the legs of the sphynx, having within it a sculptured
lion and a small sphynx. In one of the paws of
the great sphynx was another temple with a sculptured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
lion standing on an altar. In front of the great sphynx
were the remains of buildings, apparently temples, and
several granite slabs with inscriptions cut into them,
some entire and others broken. One of these is by
Claudius Cæsar, recording his visits to the pyramids,
and another by Antoninus Pius, both of which, with the
little lions, are now in the British Museum.</p>

<p class="no-indent">With the progress of civilization, Enterprise took more
diversified forms. First, man was summoned to display
this commanding quality of mind in the subjugation or
destruction of the stronger and fiercer animals; then he
had to enter on the perilous adventure into strange
regions by land, and the hazardous transit of the ocean,
in search of still more unknown countries. We have
just glanced at another department of enterprise—the
search for antiquities; and the subject was placed in
this order because it seemed naturally connected with
the perils of travel. But enterprise had taken a thousand
forms before men began to venture on great dangers
for the attainment of more certain knowledge of the
past: the hewing of rocks and levelling of forests, the
disembowelling of mines, the construction of highways
and harbours, the erection of bridges and lighthouses, of
Cyclopæan piles and pyramids, of obelisks and columns,
of aqueducts and walls of cities—these, and a thousand
other displays of strength, genius, and skill, were among
the “Triumphs of Enterprise” ages ago, and they are
now succeeded by the formation of railways, and the
myriad-fold enterprises of modern science.</p>

<p>How much would we not give for an authentic account
of those mysterious enterprises—the building of Stonehenge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
of the round towers of Ireland, and of the multitudinous
“Druidical” monuments, as they are termed,
which are scattered in immense masses over Spain and
other parts of the continent? We are left to conjecture
for their origin, and our knowledge of it may never reach
to certainty. The venerable pyramids themselves are
equally mysterious, both as it regards the purposes for
which they were erected and the means of erecting them.
The Cyclopæan masses of stone which form the foundations
of the ruined temple at Balbec (masses which
dwarf the stones of the Pyramids), as well as the recently
discovered remains in Central America, stretch back
into the far past, and also puzzle and confound all human
judgment and reckoning.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Stonehenge.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Again, even of some of the more recent erections of
antiquity, opinion is divided as to the true cause of carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
out such enterprises. In this predicament antiquarian
criticism places the Roman aqueducts—those
immense structures, formed often of several miles of
arches, on which water was conveyed over valleys. From
a passage in Pliny it is argued that the Romans were
really acquainted with the hydrostatic truth that water
will rise to its own level; that these immense edifices
were erected rather from reasons of state policy than
from ignorance, the construction of them serving to
employ turbulent spirits. All this, however, is doubtful,
and it may be that real ignorance stimulated the Romans
to carry on and complete these gigantic undertakings
which abound in their empire. One, it may be observed,
which was begun by Caius Cæsar, but completed by
Claudius, and therefore called the Claudian aqueduct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
was forty miles in length, and was raised sufficiently to
distribute water over the seven hills of the imperial
mistress of the world.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Ruins of the Temple at Balbec.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But above all the civil enterprises of the Romans we
ought to place their roads; these grand and enduring
highways, indeed, stamped Europe with a new feature,
and the civilized likeness thus impressed on her was not
effaced until railroads gave the initiative to a new civilization.
We cannot refrain from quoting Gibbon’s
masterly description of the Roman highways; it occurs
after he has been depicturing the subordinate Roman
capitals in Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt:—“All these
cities were connected with each other and with the
capital by the public highways, which, issuing from the
Forum at Rome, traversed Italy, pervaded the provinces,
and were terminated only by the frontiers of the empire.
If we carefully trace the distance from the wall of Antoninus
(in Scotland) to Rome, and from thence to
Jerusalem, it will be found that the great chain of communication
from the north-west to the south-east point
of the empire was drawn out to the length of 4080
Roman (or 3740 English) miles. The public roads were
accurately divided by milestones, and ran in a direct line
from one city to another, with very little respect for the
obstacles either of nature or private property. Mountains
were perforated, and bold arches thrown over the
broadest and most rapid streams; the middle part of
the road was raised into a terrace which commanded the
adjacent country, consisting of several strata of sand,
gravel, and cement, and was paved with large stones, or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
in some places near the capital, with granite. Such was
the solid construction of the Roman highways, whose
firmness has not entirely yielded to the effect of fifteen
centuries. They united the subjects of the most distant
provinces by an easy and familiar intercourse; but their
primary object had been to facilitate the marches of the
legions, nor was any country considered as completely
subdued till it had been rendered in all its parts pervious
to the arms and authority of the conqueror. The advantage
of receiving the earliest intelligence, and of conveying
their orders with celerity, induced the emperors to
establish throughout their extensive dominions the
regular institution of posts. Houses were everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
erected at the distance of five or six miles; each of them
was constantly provided with forty horses, and by the
help of these relays it was easy to travel a hundred
miles in a day along the Roman roads. The use of the
posts was allowed to those who claimed it by an imperial
mandate; but though originally intended for the public
service, it was sometimes indulged to the business or
conveniency of private citizens.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_247" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_247.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">St. Peter’s at Rome.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From other accounts we learn that the Roman roads
varied in importance and uses. The great lines were
called “Prætorian ways,” as being under the direction
of the prætors, and those formed the roads for military
intercourse. Other lines were exclusively adapted for
commerce or civil intercourse, and were under the direction
of consuls. Both kinds were formed in a similar
manner. The plan on which they were made was more
calculated for durability than ease to the traveller, and
for our modern wheel carriages they would be found
particularly objectionable. Whatever was their entire
breadth the centre constituted the beaten track, and was
made of large ill-dressed stones laid side by side to form
a compact mass of from twelve to twenty feet broad, and
therefore in their external aspect they were but coarse
stone causeways.</p>

<p>Some of the Roman roads had double lines of this
solid pavement, with a smooth brick path for foot passengers,
and at intervals along the sides there were
elevated stones on which travellers could rest, or from
which cavalry could easily mount their horses. One
important feature in the construction of all the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
roads was the bottoming of them with solid materials.
Their first operation seems to have been the removal of
all loose earth or soft matter which might work upwards
to the surface, and then they laid courses of small stones
or broken tiles and earthenware, with a course of cement
above, and upon that were placed the heavy stones for
the causeway; thus a more substantial and durable pavement
was formed, the expense being defrayed from the
public treasury. Various remains of Roman roads of
this kind still exist in France, and also in different parts
of Britain. One of the chief Roman thoroughfares, in
an oblique direction across the country from London to
the western part of Scotland, was long known by the name
of Watling Street, and the name has been perpetuated in
the appellation of one of the streets of the metropolis.</p>

<p>In the construction of their amphitheatres and other
places of public amusement, the Romans far transcended
modern nations, in none of which does a theatre exist of
dimensions at all comparable with those of the cities in
the Roman empire. The ruins of the Colosseum, in
Rome itself, are the source of wonder to every visitor.
The beautiful lines of Byron on these magnificent remains
of Roman civilization are well known.</p>

<p>Respecting numerous other enterprises of the ancient
world, interesting but imperfect accounts remain. Such
are the narratives of what were termed the “Seven
Wonders of the World.” It is time, however, to leave
antiquity—or, at least, classic antiquity—to speak of one
wondrous enterprise—that of a nation at the very “ends
of the earth,” of whom indeed many wonders are told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Bell, the enterprising traveller, presents, perhaps, the
clearest account of the celebrated “Great Wall of China.”</p>

<p>“On the 2nd of November, 1720, about noon,” says
he, “we could perceive the famous wall, running along
the tops of the mountains, towards the north-east. One
of our people cried out ‘land!’ as if we had been all
this while at sea. It was now, as nearly as I can compute,
about forty English miles from us, and appeared
white at this distance. The appearance of it, running
from one high rock to another, with square towers at
certain intervals, even at this distance is most magnificent.”</p>

<p>In two days they arrived at the foot of this mighty
barrier, and entered through a great gate into China.
Here a thousand men were perpetually on guard, by the
officers commanding whom they were received with much
politeness, and invited to tea.</p>

<p>“The long, or endless wall, as it is commonly called,”
continues Bell, “encompasses all the north and west
parts of China. It was built about six hundred years
ago by one of the emperors, to prevent the frequent
incursions of the Mongols and other western Tartars,
who made a practice of assembling numerous troops of
horse and invading the country in different places. The
Chinese frontiers were too extensive to be guarded
against such bold and numerous enemies, who, after
plundering and destroying a wealthy country, returned
to their own loaded with spoils.</p>

<p>“The Chinese, finding all precautions ineffectual to
put a stop to the inroads of such barbarians, at last resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
to build this famous wall. It begins in the province
of Leotong, at the bottom of the Bay of Nankin,
and proceeds across rivers, and over the tops of the
highest mountains, without interruption, keeping nearly
along the circular ridge of barren rocks that surround
the country to the north and west; and, after running
southwards about twelve hundred English miles, ends in
impassable mountains and sandy deserts.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_251" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_251.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Part of the Great Wall of China.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is an engraving of a small portion of this wonderful
work. At the top is represented a piece of the wall,
with one of the towers, as it is seen by a person standing
on the ground. Immediately under it is a bird’s-eye view
of the same, representing the dimensions and position of
the tower, in relation to the wall. And on the left side is
a section which shows how the masonry is constructed—of
two walls getting thinner towards the top, and the intermediate
space filled in with work of a rougher kind.</p>

<p>“The foundation consists of large blocks of square
stones, laid in mortar; but the rest of the wall is built
of brick. The whole is so strong and well built as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
need almost no repair, and, in such a dry climate, may
remain in this condition for many ages. Its height and
breadth are not equal in every place; nor, indeed, is it
necessary they should. When carried over steep rocks,
where no horse can pass, it is about fifteen or twenty
feet high, and broad in proportion; but, when running
through a valley, or crossing a river, there you see a
strong wall, about thirty feet high, with square towers
at the distance of a bow-shot from one another, and
embrasures at equal distances. The top of the wall is
flat, and paved with broad freestones; and where it rises
over a rock, or any eminence, you ascend by a fine easy
stone stair. The bridges over rivers and torrents are
exceedingly neat, being both well contrived and executed.
They have two stories of arches, one above another,
to afford sufficient passage for the waters on sudden
rains and floods.”</p>

<p>Bell was also informed by the Chinese that this wall
was completed within the space of five years; every
sixth man in the empire having been compelled to work
at it, or find a substitute. The date of its erection, however,
is considered uncertain; and therefore this account
may also be untrue. Gibbon gives the third century
before the Christian era as the date of its construction,
and assigns it a length of fifteen hundred miles. Du
Pauw reduces the length to four hundred and fifty miles,
not choosing to consider the western branch, “which,”
he says, “is of earth, worthy the name of a wall.”
Many writers judge it to be a very recent work, or, at
least, of as modern a date as on this side the thirteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
century, since it is not mentioned by Marco Polo. Yet
<em>tea</em> is not mentioned by him, although the Chinese have
used it for thousands of years. If it be true that much
of Marco Polo’s manuscript was destroyed because his
friends ignorantly believed his wondrous relations (such
as the burning of a “black stone,” or coal, by the
Chinese, for fuel) to be false, the omission of allusions
to the Great Wall, in <em>our</em> copies of Marco Polo will be
no argument against its antiquity.</p>

<p>Next to the Great Wall, the Porcelain Tower of
Nankin is usually classed as the great marvel of China.
The following curious description of this temple of
Boudh, for such the porcelain pagoda is, was purchased
in the city of Nankin, on the return of one of our
English embassies, and was first published in a leading
periodical, which was furnished with a translation by
Sir George Staunton, the celebrated scholar and traveller.</p>

<p>“The Dwelling of Security, Tranquillity, and Peace.
The representation of the precious glazed tower of the
Temple of Gratitude, in the province of Kiang-Nan.</p>

<p>“This work was commenced at noon, on the fifteenth
day of the sixth moon, of the tenth year of the Emperor
Yong Lo (1413 of the Christian era), of the
Dynasty of Ming, and was completed on the first day of
the eighth moon, of the sixth year of the Emperor Siuen
Té, of the same dynasty, being altogether a period of
nineteen years in building.</p>

<p>“The sum of money expended in completing the
precious glazed tower was two millions four hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
eighty-five thousand, four hundred and eighty-four ounces
of silver. In the construction of the ornamental globe
on the pinnacle of the roof of the tower, forty-eight <em>kin</em>
(one pound and one-third) in weight of gold (sixty-four
pounds), and one thousand four hundred <em>kin</em> in weight
of copper were consumed. The circumference of this
globe is thirty-six <em>che</em> (about fourteen inches). Each
round or story is eighteen <em>che</em> high. In that part of the
tower called the quang were consumed four thousand
eight hundred and seventy <em>kin</em> weight of brass. The
iron hoops or rings on the pinnacle of the roof are nine
in number, and sixty-three <em>che</em> each in circumference.
The smaller hoops are twenty-four <em>che</em> in circumference,
and their total weight is three thousand six hundred
<em>kin</em>.</p>

<p>“On different parts of the tower are suspended eighty-one
iron bells, each bell weighing twelve <em>kin</em>, or sixteen
pounds. There are also nine iron chains, each of which
weighs one hundred and fifty <em>kin</em>, and is eighty <em>che</em> long.
The copper pan with two mouths to it on the roof is
estimated to weigh nine hundred <em>kin</em>, and is sixty <em>che</em> in
circumference. There is also a celestial plate on the
top weighing four hundred and sixty <em>kin</em>, and twenty <em>che</em>
in circumference. In the upper part of the tower are
preserved the following articles:—Of night-illuminating
pearls, one string; of water-repelling pearls, one string;
of fire-repelling pearls, one string; of dust-repelling
pearls, one string; and over all these is a string of Fo’s
relics. Also an ingot of solid gold, weighing forty <em>leang</em>
(ounces), and one hundred <em>kin</em> weight of tea; of silver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
one thousand <em>leang</em> weight; of the bright huing, two
pieces, weighing one hundred <em>kin</em>; of precious stones,
one string; of the everlasting physic-money, one thousand
strings; of yellow satin, two pieces; of the book
hidden in the earth, one copy; of the book of Omitd Fo,
one copy; of the book of She Kia Fo, one copy; of the
book of Tsie Yin Fo, one copy; all wrapped up together,
and preserved in the temple.</p>

<p>“The tower has eight sides or faces, and its circumference
is two hundred and forty <em>che</em>. The nine stories
taken together are two hundred and twenty-eight and
a half <em>che</em> high. From the highest story to the extreme
point of the pinnacle of the roof are one hundred and
twenty <em>che</em>. The lamps within the tower are seven times
seven in number, in all forty-nine lamp-dishes, and on
the outside there are one hundred and twenty-eight
lamp-dishes. Each night they are supplied with fifty
<em>kin</em> weight of oil. Their splendour penetrates upwards
to the thirty-third heaven—mid-way; they shed a lustre
over the people, the good and bad together—downwards;
they illuminate the earth as far as the City of Tse Kee
Hien, in the Province of Che-Kiang.</p>

<p>“The official title of the head priest of the temple is
Chao Sieu. His disciples are called Yue. The total
number of priests on the establishment is eight hundred
and fifty. The family name of the head mason of the
building was Yao, his personal name Sieu, and his native
town Tsing Kiang Foo. The family name of the head
carpenter was Hoo, his personal name Chung, and his
native province Kiang See.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“The extent of the whole enclosure of the temple is
seven hundred and seventy <em>meu</em> (somewhat less than an
English acre) and eight-tenths. To the southward,
towards Chin Van San, are two hundred and twenty-six
<em>meu</em>. Eastward, to the boundary of Chin Sien Seng, are
two hundred and thirty-four <em>meu</em> and eight-tenths. In
the centre is the ground of Hoo Kin Te. Westward, as
far as the land of She Hon Hoa, are one hundred and
twenty <em>meu</em>. And northward, to the land of Lien Sien
Song, are one hundred and eighty <em>meu</em>.</p>

<p>“Viewing, therefore, this History of the Glazed Tower,
may it not be considered as the work of a Divinity?
Who shall perform the like?</p>

<p>“Lately, on the fifteenth day of the fifth moon, of the
fifth year of Kia King, at four in the morning, the God
of Thunder, in his pursuit of a monstrous dragon, followed
it into this temple, struck three of the sides of the
fabric, and materially damaged the ninth story; but the
strength and majesty of the God of the temple are most
potent, and the laws of Fo are not subject to change.
The tower, by his influence, was therefore saved from
entire destruction. The Viceroy and the Foo-Yen reported
the circumstance to his imperial majesty; and,
on the sixth day of the second moon of the seventh year,
the restoration of the damaged parts was commenced,
and on the nineteenth day of the fifth moon the repairs
were completed.</p>

<p>“On the twenty-ninth day of the sixth moon of the
twelfth year of his present majesty, at four in the afternoon,
on a sudden there fell a heavy shower of rain, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
the God of Thunder again rushed forth in front of the
tower, and, penetrating the roof, pursued the great dragon
from the top to the bottom. The glazed porcelain tiles
of the sixth story were much damaged, and where the
God of Thunder issued out at the great gate several of
the boards taken from the wood of the heavenly flower-tree
were broken. Thus, the God of Thunder, having
finally driven away the monstrous dragon, returned to
his place in the heavens.</p>

<p>“The priests of the temple reported the event to the
local authorities, and the officer Hen submitted the
report to his Imperial Majesty, and awaited the issue of
the sums required to defray the charge of the repairs.
The gates of the tower have been closed for a year while
the interior has been repairing.</p>

<p>Such is the singular register of the Porcelain Pagoda
at Nankin. The terraced mountains have been often
mentioned as another wonder of China; but recent
travellers declare that these enterprises are exceedingly
few in the “flowery” land.</p>

<p>To revert to Europe; the great difficulty is to select
the themes of Enterprise. Here is one, however, of a
somewhat rude, but yet highly adventurous, and also
highly useful kind. It is a sketch of a Swiss wonder—the
famous “Slide of Alpnach.”</p>

<p>For many centuries the rugged flanks and deep gorges
of Mount Pilatus were covered by impenetrable forests;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
lofty precipices encircled them on all sides. Even the
daring hunters were scarcely able to reach them, and the
inhabitants of the valley never conceived the idea of
disturbing them with the axe. These immense forests
were therefore allowed to grow and perish, the most
intelligent and skilful considering it quite impracticable
to avail themselves of such inaccessible stores.</p>

<p>In November, 1816, Mr. John Rulph, of Rentingen,
and three other Swiss gentlemen, entertaining more
sanguine hopes, drew up a plan of a slide, founded on
trigonometrical measurements; and, having purchased
a certain extent of the forests from the commune of
Alpnach for 6000 crowns, began the construction of it.</p>

<p>The slide of Alpnach was formed of about 25,000 large
pine trees, deprived of their bark, and united together
without the aid of iron. It occupied about one hundred
and sixty workmen during eighteen months, and cost
nearly one hundred thousand francs, or 4166<em>l.</em> It was
about three leagues, or 44,000 English feet long, and
terminated in the Lake of Lucerne. It had the form of
a trough about six feet broad, and from three to six deep.
Its bottom was formed of three trees, the middle one of
which had a groove cut out in the direction of its length,
for receiving small rills of water for the purpose of
diminishing the friction. The whole slide was sustained
by about two thousand supports, and in many places
was attached in a very ingenious manner to the rugged
precipices of granite. The direction of the slide was
sometimes straight and sometimes zigzag, with an inclination
of from ten to eighteen degrees. It was often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
carried along the sides of precipitous rocks, and sometimes
over their summits; occasionally it passed underground,
and at other times over the deep gorges by
scaffoldings one hundred and twenty feet high.</p>

<p>Before any step could be taken in its erection it was
necessary to cut several thousand trees to obtain a passage
through the impenetrable thickets; and as the workmen
advanced, men were posted at certain distances in order
to point out the road for their return. Mr. Rulph was
often obliged to be suspended by cords, in order to
descend precipices many hundred feet high, to give
directions, having scarcely two good carpenters among
his men, they having been hired as the occasion offered.</p>

<p>All difficulties being at length surmounted, the larger
pines, which were about one hundred feet long, and ten
inches thick at their smaller extremity, ran through the
space of <em>three leagues</em>, or <em>nearly nine miles</em>, in <em>three
minutes and a half</em>; and, during their descent, appeared
to be only a few feet in length. The arrangements were
extremely simple. Men were posted at regular distances
along the slide, and as soon as everything was ready the
man at the bottom called out to the next one above
him, “<em>Lachez!</em>”—Let go! The cry was repeated, and
reached the top of the slide in three minutes; the man
at the top of the slide then cried out to the one below,
“<em>Il vient!</em>”—It comes! As soon as the tree had
reached the bottom, and plunged into the lake, the cry
of “<em>Lachez!</em>” was repeated as before. By these means
a tree descended every five or six minutes. When a
tree, by accident, escaped from the trough of the slide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
it often penetrated by its thickest extremity from eighteen
to twenty-four feet into the earth, and if it struck another
tree, it cleft it with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p>Such was the enterprising work undertaken and
executed under the direction of a single individual.
This wondrous structure, however, no longer exists, and
scarcely a tree is to be seen on the flanks of Mount
Pilatus. Political events having taken away the demand
for timber, and another market having been found, the
operation of cutting and transporting the trees necessarily
ceased.</p>

<p>Let us now glance at the enterprise of erecting a more
durable monument. Russia, proud of her Czar, the
celebrated Peter the Great, wished to erect a monument
to his memory. Catherine the Second was the monarch
who had the direction of the work, and her choice for an
artist fell upon M. Falconet, who, in his conception of
an equestrian statue, resolved that the subordinate parts
should bear an equal impress of genius. “The pedestals
in general use,” he observed, “had no distinctive feature,
and adapt themselves equally well to any subject. Being
of so universal application they suggest no new or
elevated thoughts to the beholder.” Falconet wished to
make the Czar appear as the father and legislator of his
people—great and extraordinary in everything—undertaking
and completing that which others were unable to
imagine. To carry out this conception a precipitous
rock was fixed on for the pedestal, on which the statue
should appear with characteristics distinguishing it from
those erected to other sovereigns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>Falconet’s first idea was to form this pedestal of six
masses of rock, bound together with bars of iron or
copper; but the objection was urged, that the natural
decay of the bands would cause a disruption of the
various parts, and present a ruinous aspect, while it
would be difficult to insure perfect uniformity in the
quality and appearance of the different blocks. The
next proposal was to form it of one whole rock; but this
appeared impossible, and in a report to the senate it
was stated that the expense would be so enormous as
almost to justify the abandonment of the undertaking.
At length it was resolved to bring to the city of
St. Petersburg the largest rock that could be found, cost
what it might.</p>

<p>The search for a huge mass of rock was begun, but
the whole summer was passed in vain exploration. The
idea of forming the pedestal of several pieces had again
been entertained, when an immense stone was discovered
near Cronstadt, which it was determined to use as the
principal mass. Various mechanics having been applied
to, refused to undertake the task of removing this stone,
as did likewise the Russian Admiralty.</p>

<p>Fortunately for M. Falconet, he was acquainted with
a native of Cephalonia, who had assumed the name of
Lascary, and who, while serving in the corps of cadets,
had given high proofs of mechanic skill. Lascary had
all along strenuously recommended the adoption of the
original design, and now undertook the formation of the
pedestal. A few days after his appointment to this
commission he received information from a peasant of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
large rock lying in a marsh near a bay in the Gulf of
Finland, about twenty miles from St. Petersburg by
water. The stone was examined, and the base, by
sounding around it, was found to be flat. It was a
parallelopipedon in form, and was forty-two feet long,
twenty-seven feet wide, and twenty-one feet high.
These were dimensions sufficiently extensive to realise
the conceptions of M. Falconet. The authorities, when
the mass was beheld, again recommended its being cut
into separate portions for convenient removal. The
Empress Catherine and her minister Betzky, were, however,
on the side of Lascary, and orders were imperatively
given to commence the strange enterprise.</p>

<p>The resolution was taken by M. Lascary to remove the
stone without the use of rollers, as these not only present
a long surface, which increases the friction and thereby
impedes speed, but are not easily made of the great
diameter that would have been required owing to the
soft and yielding nature of the ground on which the
work was to be performed. Spherical bodies, revolving
in a metallic groove, were then chosen as the means of
transport. These offered many advantages; their motion
is more prompt than that of rollers, with a less degree of
friction, as they present but small points of contact.
Beams of wood, of a foot square, and thirty-three feet in
length, were then prepared; one side was hollowed in
the form of a gutter, and lined, the sides being convex to
the thickness of two inches, with a composition of copper
and tin. Balls of the same composite metal, five inches
in diameter, were then made, to bear only on the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
of the groove. These beams were intended to be placed
on the ground in a line in front of the stone, while upon
them were reversed two other beams prepared in a similar
manner, each forty-two feet long and one foot and a half
square, connected as a frame by stretchers and bars of
iron fourteen feet in length, carefully secured by nuts,
screws, and bolts.</p>

<p>A load of three thousand pounds, when placed on the
working model (which had been first constructed) was
found to move with ease. Betzky, the minister, was
pleased with the exhibition of the model; but the crowds
who came to witness it cried, “A mountain upon eggs!”
But Lascary was not to be driven from his purpose, so
intelligently formed, by a little unthinking clamour.</p>

<p>The rock lay in a wild and deserted part of the
country, and therefore the first thing to be done was to
build barracks capable of accommodating four hundred
labourers, artisans, and others. These, with M. Lascary,
were all lodged on the spot, as the readiest means of
forwarding the work. From the rock to the river Neva
a line of road was then cleared a distance of six versts,
or twenty-one thousand English feet, to a width of one
hundred and twenty feet, in order to gain space for the
various operations and to give a free circulation of air,
so essential to the health of workmen in a marshy district,
as well as to the drying and freezing of the ground—a
point of much importance when the enormous weight
to be removed is considered. The operation of disinterring
the rock was commenced in December, when the
influence of the frosts began to be felt. It was embedded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
to the depth of fifteen feet; the excavation required to
be of great width—eighty-four feet all round—to admit
of turning the stone, which did not lie in the most
favourable position for removal. An inclined plane, six
hundred feet in length, was afterwards made, by means
of which, when the stone was turned, it might be drawn
up to the level surface.</p>

<p>Objectors said it would be impossible to place the
monster mass of rock upon the machine destined to
transport it; but Lascary was still unshaken. Preferring
simplicity to complication, he resolved to employ
ordinary levers, known technically as levers of the first
order. These were made of three masts, each sixty-five
feet in length, and a foot and a half in diameter at the
larger end, firmly bound together. To lessen the difficulty
of moving these, triangles of thirty feet high were
erected, with windlasses attached near the base, from
which a cord, passing through a pulley at the top, was
fastened to the smaller end of the lever, which being
drawn up to the top of the triangle, was ready for the
operation of turning; each of these levers was calculated
to raise a weight of two hundred thousand pounds.</p>

<p>A row of piles had been driven into the ground at the
proper distance from the stone on one side, to serve as a
fulcrum; and on the other a series of piles were disposed
as a platform, to prevent the sinking of the mass on its
descent. Twelve levers, with three men to each, were
stationed at the side to be lifted, and the lower extremities
being placed under the mass, the upper ends were
drawn downwards by the united action of the twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
windlasses. When the stone rose to the height of a
foot, beams and wedges were then driven underneath to
maintain it in that position, while the levers were
arranged for a second lift. To assist the action of the
levers, large iron rings were soldered into the upper
corner of the rock, from which small cables were passed
to four capstans, each turned by thirty-six men, thus
maintaining a steady strain, while the stone was prevented
from returning to its original position when the
levers were shifted. These operations were repeated
until the rock was raised nearly to an equipoise, when
cables from six other capstans were attached to the
opposite side, to guard against a too sudden descent;
and as a further precaution against fracture, a bed six
feet in thickness, of hay and moss intermingled, was
placed to receive the rock, on which it was at length
happily laid. As it was of great importance that all the
workmen should act at one and the same time, two drummers
were stationed on the top of the stone, who, at a
sign from the engineer, gave the necessary signals on
their drums, and secured the certainty of order and precision
in the various operations.</p>

<p>The machinery for the removal had, in the meantime,
been finished. Of the lower grooved beams already
described, six pairs were prepared, so that when the rock
had advanced over one pair they might be drawn forward
and placed in a line in advance of the foremost,
without interrupting the movements. The balls were
laid in the grooves two feet apart; the upper frame,
intended as the bed for the rock, placed above. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
mass, weighing in its original form four millions of
pounds, or nearly eighteen hundred tons, was then raised
by means of powerful screws, and deposited on the frame,
when it was drawn up the inclined plane by the united
force of six capstans. The road did not proceed in a
direct line to the river, owing to the soft state of portions
of the marsh. It was impossible in many places to reach
a firm foundation with piles fifty feet in length. This
naturally added to the difficulties of the transport, as the
direction of the draught had frequently to be changed.
Piles were driven along the whole line on both sides, at
distances of three hundred feet apart; to these the cables
were made fast, while the capstans revolved, two of
which were found sufficient to draw the stone on a level
surface, while on unequal ground four were required.
From five hundred to twelve hundred feet were got over
daily, which, when regard is had to the short winter days
of five hours in that high latitude, may be considered as
rapid.</p>

<p>So interesting was the spectacle of the enormous mass
when moving, with the two drummers at their posts, the
forge erected on it continually at work, and forty workmen
constantly employed in reducing it to a regular
form, that the empress and the court visited the spot to
see the novel sight; and notwithstanding the rigour of
the season, crowds of persons of all ranks went out every
day as spectators. Small flat sledges were attached to
each side of the stone by ropes, on which were seated
men provided with iron levers, whose duty it was to prevent
the balls, of which fifteen on a side were used, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
striking against each other and thus impeding the motion.
The tool-house was also attached, and moved with the
stone, in order that everything might be ready to hand
when wanted. Balls and grooves of cast-iron were tried,
but this material crumbled into fragments as readily as
if made with clay. No metal was found to bear the
weight so well as the mixture of copper and tin, and
even with this the balls were sometimes flattened and
the grooves curled up when the pressure by any accident
became unequal. The utility of rollers was also tried;
but with double the number of capstans and the power,
the cables broke, while the stone did not advance one
inch.</p>

<p>Suddenly the enterprise was checked by the sinking
of the stone to a depth of eighteen inches in the road, to
the chagrin of the engineer, who was suffering under a
severe attack of marsh fever. Lascary, however, was
not disheartened, and speedily remedied the accident,
spite of the idle clamours of the multitude; and in six
weeks from the time of first drawing the stone from its
bed, he had the satisfaction of seeing it safely deposited
on the temporary wharf built for the purpose of embarkation
on the banks of the river, when the charge fell into
the hands of the Admiralty, who had undertaken the
transport by water to the city.</p>

<p>The Russian Admiralty had ordered a vessel or barge
one hundred and eighty feet in length, sixty-six feet in
width, and seventeen feet from deck to keel, to be built,
with every appliance that skill could suggest to render
it capable of supporting the enormous burthen. Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
precautions were now necessary to prevent the rock
falling into the stream. Water was let into the vessel
until she sank to the bottom of the river, which brought
her deck on a level with the wharf; the rock was then
drawn on board by means of two capstans placed on the
deck of another vessel anchored at some distance from
the shore. Pumps and buckets were now brought into
use to clear the barge of the water with which she had
been filled; but, to the surprise and consternation of
those engaged, she did not rise equally; the centres bearing
most of the weight remained at the bottom, while
the head and stern springing up gave to the whole the
form of a sharp curve; the timbers gave way, and, the
seams opening, the water re-entered rapidly; four hundred
men were then set to bale, in order that every part
might be simultaneously cleared; but the curve became
greater in proportion to the diminution of the internal
volume of water.</p>

<p>Lascary, who, from the time the rock had been placed
on the deck of the vessel, had been a simple spectator of
these operations, which occupied two weeks, now received
orders to draw it again upon the wharf. He immediately
applied himself to remedy the error, which had been
committed in not distributing the weight equally, without
removing the stone. He first caused the head and
stern of the barge to be loaded with large stones, until
they sank to a level with the centre; the rock was then
raised by means of screws and beams of timber, diverging
to every part of the vessel, placed under and against it,
and, on the removal of the screws, the pressure being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
equal in every part, she regained her original form. The
water was next pumped out, the stones removed from
the head and stern, and a ship lashed on each side of the
barge, which on the 22nd of September, 1769, arrived
opposite the quay where it was intended to erect the
statue. The rock was raised from the spot where it was
first found at the end of March preceding.</p>

<p>The debarkation—not the least hazardous part of the
enterprise—had yet to be accomplished. As the river
was here of a greater depth than at the place of embarkation,
rows of piles had been driven into the bottom
alongside the quay, and cut off level at a distance of
eight feet below the surface. On these the barge was
rested; to prevent the recurrence of the rising of the
head and stern when the supports should be removed,
three masts lashed together, crossing the deck at each
extremity, were secured to the surface of the quay. It
was then feared that, as the rock approached the shore,
the vessel might heel and precipitate it into the river.
This was obviated by fixing six other masts to the quay,
which projected across the whole breadth of the deck,
and were made fast to a vessel moored outside, thus
presenting a counterpoise to the weight of the stone.
The grooved beams were laid ready, the cables secured,
and, at the moment of removing the last support, the
drummers beat the signal, the men at the capstans ran
round with a cheer, the barge heeled slightly, which
accelerated the movement, and in an instant the rock
was safety landed on the quay.</p>

<p>The whole expense of the removal of this gigantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
rock was about 70,000 roubles, or 14,000<em>l.</em>, while the
materials which remained were worth two-thirds of
the sum.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_271.jpg" alt="Horse and rider statue">
</figure>

<p>Dr. Granville, in his “Travels to St. Petersburg,”
describing the public promenade in front of the Admiralty
in that city, says, “Here the colossal equestrian
statue of the founder of this magnificent city, placed on
a granite rock, seems to command the undivided attention
of the stranger. On approaching the rock, the
simple inscription fixed on it in bronze letters, ‘Petro
Primo, Catherina Secunda, <span class="allsmcap">MDCCLXXXII</span>,’ meets the eye.
The same inscription in the Russian language appears
on the opposite side. The area is inclosed within a
handsome railing placed between granite pillars. The
idea of Falconet, the French architect, commissioned to
erect an equestrian statue to the extraordinary man at
whose command a few scattered huts of fishermen were
converted into palaces, was to represent the hero as conquering,
by enterprise and personal courage, difficulties
almost insurmountable. This the artist imagined might
be properly represented by placing Peter on a fiery steed
which he is supposed to have taught by skill, management,
and perseverance, to rush up a steep and precipitous
rock, to the very brink of the precipice, over
which the animal and the imperial rider pause, without
fear, and in an attitude of triumph. The horse rears
with his fore-feet in the air, and seems to be impatient
of restraint, while the sovereign, turned towards the
island, surveys with calm and serene countenance his
capital rising out of the waters, over which he extends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
the hand of protection. The bold manner in which the
group has been made to rest on the hind legs of the
horse only, is not more surprising than the skill with
which advantage is taken of the allegorical figure of the
serpent of envy spurned by the horse, to assist in upholding
so gigantic a mass. This monument of bronze
is said to have been cast at a single jet. The head was
modelled by Mademoiselle Calot, a female artist of great
merit, a contemporary of Falconet, and is admitted to
be a strong resemblance of Peter the Great. The height
of the figure of the emperor is eleven feet; that of the
horse seventeen feet. The bronze is in the thinnest parts
the fourth of an inch only, and one inch in the thickest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
part; the general weight of metal in the group is equal
to 36,636 English pounds. I heard a venerable Russian
nobleman, who was living at St. Petersburg when this
monument was in progress, relate that as soon as the
artist had formed his conception of the design he communicated
it to the empress, together with the impossibility
of representing to nature so striking a position of
man and animal, without having before his eyes a horse
and rider in the attitude he had devised. General
Melissino, an officer having the reputation of being the
most expert as well as boldest rider of the day, to whom
the difficulties of the architect were made known, offered
to ride daily one of Count Alexis Orloff’s best Arabians
out of that nobleman’s stud, to the summit of a steep
artificial mound formed for the purpose, accustoming
the horse to gallop up to it and to halt suddenly, with
his fore-legs raised, pawing the air over the brink of a
precipice. This dangerous experiment was carried into
effect by the general for some days, in the presence of
several spectators, and of Falconet, who sketched the
various movements and parts of the groups from day to
day, and was thus enabled to produce perhaps the finest—certainly
the most correct—statue of the kind in
Europe.”</p>

<p>It thus appears that <em>enterprise</em> characterised not only
Lascary, the engineer, but Falconet, the artist, Melissino,
the officer who undertook to depict the living model,
and in brief, the entire deed from beginning to end.
How strikingly might the parallel be continued with
Peter himself! The young reader will find the history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
of the Czar, which he can peruse in various forms, pregnant
with lessons of enterprise to a degree beyond that
of any modern man, with the exception of Napoleon.
In both their histories, however, we are compelled to
remind him, there is much to censure; and in the history
of the latter especially, much more to censure than
to praise.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_b_273" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_273.jpg" alt="Napoleon">
</figure>

<p>If our own country be viewed with strictness, it will
be found that we have no great work of ornamental
enterprise simply, at all comparable to the one just
sketched. Russia, nevertheless, can bear no comparison
with England in point of useful enterprises; she has
nothing, for instance, like the Eddystone light-house or
the Plymouth breakwater. A few brief sentences will
serve to sketch the former.</p>

<p>The first light-house built on the Eddystone rock was
constructed by Winstanley, in 1696 to 1700. While<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
some repairs were making under his inspection, the
building was blown down in a terrible hurricane, during
the night of the 26th of November, 1703, and he and
his workmen perished. Not a vestige, except some iron
stanchions and a chain, was left behind.</p>

<p>Rudyerd, in 1706, erected another, which was destroyed
by fire, in 1755; it was entirely of wood, except
the five lower courses of stone, on the rock.</p>

<p>The present edifice is a circular tower of stone sweeping
up with a gentle curve from the base, and gradually
diminishing to the top, somewhat similar to the swelling
of the trunk of a tree. The tower is furnished with a
door and windows, and a staircase and ladders for ascending
to the lantern, through the apartments of those
who keep watch. Mr. Smeaton undertook the arduous
task of constructing the present light-house, in the
spring of 1756, and completed it in about three years.
In order to form his foundation, Smeaton accurately
measured the very irregular surface of the rock, and
made a model of it. Granite partially worked, forms
the foundation; every outside piece is grafted into the
rock, to sustain more effectually the action of the sea;
a border of three inches effects also a kind of socket for
the foundation. Each course of masonry is dovetailed
together, in the most skilful manner, and each layer of
masonry is strongly cemented together and connected
by oaken plugs, and the whole strongly cramped. The
general weight of the stones employed is a ton, and some
few are two tons. In the solid work the centre stones
were fixed first, and all the courses were fitted on a platform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
and accurately adjusted before they were removed
to the rock.</p>

<p>The base of the tower is about twenty-six feet nine
inches in diameter; the diameter at the top of the solid
masonry is about nineteen feet nine inches; and the
height of the solid masonry is thirteen feet from the
foundation. The height of the tower from the centre
of the base is sixty-one feet seven inches; the lantern,
the base of which is stone, is twenty-four feet. The
whole height is eighty-five feet seven inches; and the
Eddystone light-house has not only the merit of utility,
but also of beauty, strength, and originality, and is itself
sufficient to immortalise the name of the architect.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_275.jpg" alt="Lighthouse">
</figure>

<p>The Breakwater thrown across Plymouth Sound is
another of the great useful enterprises of Britain. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Rennie was the distinguished engineer appointed to perform
this work. He knew that to resist the force of the
heavy sea which rolls into the Sound from the south and
south-west, a very considerable slope would be necessary
for the breakwater, and accordingly, it is so constructed.
He also perceived that great masses of stones from one
to ten tons each would be required.</p>

<p>The quarries from which these were procured are
situated at Oreston on the eastern shore of Catwater;
they lie under a surface of about twenty-five acres, and
were purchased from the Duke of Bedford for £10,000.
They consist of one vast mass of compact close-grained
marble, many specimens of which are beautifully variegated;
seams of clay, however, are interspersed through
the rock, in which there are large cavities, some empty,
and others partially filled with clay. In one of these
caverns in the solid rock, fifteen feet wide, forty-five feet
long, and twelve feet deep, filled nearly with compact
clay, were found imbedded fossil bones belonging to the
rhinoceros, being portions of the skeletons of three different
animals, all of them in the most perfect state of
preservation, every part of their surface being entire to
a degree which Sir Everard Home said he had never
observed in specimens of that kind before. The part of
the cavity in which these bones were found was seventy
feet below the surface of the solid rock, sixty feet horizontally
from the edge of the cliff where it was first
begun to work the quarry, and one hundred and sixty
feet from the original edge of the Catwater. Every side
of the cavern was solid rock, the inside had no incrustation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
of stalactite, nor was there any external communication
through the rock in which it was imbedded, nor
any appearance of an opening from above being closed
by infiltration. When, therefore, and in what manner
these bones came into that situation, is among the secret
and wonderful operations of nature which will probably
never be revealed to mankind.</p>

<p>M. Dupin, an intelligent observer of our great naval
and commercial enterprises gives the following description
of the working of the quarries from which the
Breakwater stone was procured.</p>

<p>“The sight of the operations which I have just described,
those enormous masses of marble that the
quarry-men strike with heavy strokes of their hammers;
and those aerial roads or flying bridges which serve for
the removal of the superstratum of earth; those lines of
cranes all at work at the same moment; the trucks all
in motion; the arrival, the loading, and the departure
of the vessels; all this forms one of the most imposing
sights that can strike a friend to the great works of art.
At fixed hours, the sound of a bell is heard in order to
announce the blastings of the quarry. The operations
instantly cease on all sides, the workmen retire; all
becomes silence and solitude; this universal silence
renders still more imposing the sound of the explosion,
the splitting of the rocks, their ponderous fall, and the
prolonged sound of the echoes.”</p>

<p>These huge blocks of stone were conveyed from the
quarries on trucks, along iron railways, to the quays,
and from thence into the holds of the vessels built expressly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
for the purpose. On their arrival over the line
of the Breakwater, they are discharged from the trucks
by means of what is called a <em>typing-frame</em>, at the stern
of the vessel, which, falling like a trap-door, lets the
stone into the sea. In this manner a cargo of sixteen
trucks, or eighteen tons, may be discharged in the space
of forty or fifty minutes. Two millions of tons of stone,
and one million sterling in money, was the calculation
made at the outset, as requisite to complete this great
national work.</p>

<p>To describe, even by a single sentence each, the great
enterprises of England—her harbours, bridges, canals,
railways, mines, manufactures, shipping—would occupy
volumes. Suffice it to say that our country has become
more and more the land of Enterprise. This, indeed,
must be the grand characteristic of the civilised world,
universally, if the old and evil passion for war be not
renewed.</p>

<p>In bygone ages the only path to prosperity for nations
was supposed to be war. Nations seemed to think that
without military “glory” they could not be great.
Modern nations patterned by the ancient; every page
of modern history, as well as ancient, is tilled with
battles and successes. The farther we look back, the
more we find it true, that violence led to splendour and
renown. Much is told of the magnificence of the
Eastern empires; but far above the glory of the temples
of Tadmor, and the gardens of Babylon, rises the glory
of Eastern conquerors on the page of history. Of all
that is recorded of Egyptian labour and Corinthian
wealth, nothing equals in fame their contemporary warriors.
The trade and merchants of Athens were not
without profit to her; but to Marathon and Platæa, to
Salamis and Mycale, she owes the admiration which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
majority in later ages have paid her. Sparta flourished,
though condemned to idleness, except in war and theft.
The trade of Carthage fell before the sword of Rome,
and not all the wares that heathen nations ever fabricated,
gave a twentieth part of the power which the
soldiers of the republic won.</p>

<p>Gradually, the truth dawns upon the world that war
is an evil immeasurable; that military glory is a false
and destructive light; and that the grandest enterprises
are those which serve to increase the comfort, happiness,
and knowledge of the race. Let the young reader bid
success to such enterprises, and enter into their spirit
with all his energy. To be engaged—to be busy—to be
earnestly at work, he will find to be one of the chief
sources of happiness; and to pass life honourably and
worthily, it is not only the duty, but the privilege, of
well-nigh every native of our own and other civilised
countries, to render existence a series of the “<span class="smcap">Triumphs
of Enterprise</span>.”</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
